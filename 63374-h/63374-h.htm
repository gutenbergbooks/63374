A RAILROAD MAN TO RAILROAD MEN</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Considering</span> the nature and intent of the following
essays on the safety problem on American
railroads, some kind of a foreword will not be out
of place. As much as possible I wish to make this
foreword a personal presentation of the subject.
But in order to do this in a satisfactory manner, it
will be necessary to take a preliminary survey of the
situation and of the topics in which we, as railroad
employees, are all personally interested.</p>

<p>In the industrial world of to-day, the railroad
man occupies a position altogether different from
the ordinary run of workers in factories or machine
shops. On account of the nature and importance of
our calling we are constantly in the public eye. By
way of encouragement and as an incentive to good
service, public opinion accords to us certain distinctive
privileges. That there may be no excuse for
laxity of conduct or inefficiency of service, we are
looked upon in many ways as wards of the state and
the nation. Not only are the hardships we endure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
and the dangers we are called upon to face matters
in which the public is profoundly interested, but
all details relating to our wages and to our treatment
by railroad corporations have always been
considered by the American people as topics in the
discussion of which they are at all times intimately
concerned.</p>

<p>Glancing backward at the history of railroad life
in America, it is easy to perceive that this public
sympathy and encouragement has been the strong
right arm that has supported the railroad employee
in a long-drawn-out struggle for the bettering of
his social and financial condition. In some directions
and in some branches of the service, the issues
at stake have been bitterly contested, but the final
results are probably unexampled among the successful
achievements of organized labor. Not only
numerically and financially, but also as regards the
intelligence and education of its units, the railroad
service to-day stands in the foremost position among
the great industrial institutions of the country.</p>

<p>The nature of the service we railroad men render
to the public in return for these benefits is most important,
and, under present conditions, extremely
dangerous. Some idea of the hazardous nature
of our occupation may be gathered from the facts
that, in a single year, one employee in every 364
was killed, and one in every 22 was injured. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
ranks of engineers, firemen, conductors, and brakemen,
one in every 123 was killed and one in every
10 was injured. This is about the average record
of recent years. It means, of course, an appalling
number of accidents, and these accidents are manifestly
an eloquent reflection of the risks to which
the traveling public is constantly exposed.</p>

<p>In many ways humanity is indebted to the railroad
man to as great a degree as to the sailor. The
latter, indeed, has greater hardships to endure; he
is not nearly so well paid, and he has to submit to
a much stricter code of discipline. But for some
reason the railroad man has the more dangerous
occupation, if one may judge from a comparison of
the fatalities that occur at sea and on the rail. In
a storm at sea, when battened down under closed
hatches, with nothing to think about but the fury
of the gale and our own helpless situation, we
appreciate to the full our dependence upon the
courage and watchfulness of the sailor. But the
public does not consider a railroad man from quite
the same viewpoint, for the reason, perhaps, that
the unavoidable dangers on the rail are not to be
compared with the ever-present peril that surrounds
a ship in its battle with the elements. And yet when
we come to compare actual results, that is, the statistics
in regard to ship travel and train travel, one
is quickly confronted with the conclusion that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
public is fully as dependent for its safety upon the
human elements of vigilance and consecration to
duty in the one case as in the other.</p>

<p>Looking at our subject from the widest standpoint,
however, it is evident that the dangers that
threaten a passenger on the steam-cars are more
numerous than the passenger himself has any idea
of, and these dangers are very uncertain in their
nature and difficult to guard against. Constant
attention and supervision is being universally exercised
by the railroad officials, for the purpose of
reducing to a minimum the number of accidents
that occur from defective equipment and the like;
but the accidents caused by the personal neglect or
carelessness of the individual employee is a branch
of the subject that calls for a very different kind
of investigation and treatment.</p>

<p>In order to get an intelligent and comprehensive
idea of these railroad accidents, both avoidable and
unavoidable, the National Government has directed
and empowered the Interstate Commerce Commission
to secure and to publish statistics on the subject.
In this way, for a number of years, the public
has been kept informed in regard to all casualties
of whatever nature that take place on our railroads.
But right here the work and influence of the National
and State Commissions, as well as of all railroad
managers and individual investigators into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
personal side of the problem, come to an end. Being
in full possession and understanding of the actual
results of our system of operating the railroad, the
authorities seem disinclined to adopt any radical
measures for the improvement of the service. In a
report prepared for Congress some time ago, by the
Interstate Commerce Commission, it was distinctly
affirmed that these avoidable accidents are mostly
due to the failure in duty of signalmen and enginemen.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no escape from the conclusion that the
block system is the best-known instrumentality for
the prevention of collisions,&#8221; says the report, &#8220;notwithstanding
the imperfections that have been
shown in the results of its operations.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to the same report, during a given
period, thirteen collisions occurred under the telegraph-block
system, and all of these, so the commissioners
say, were chargeable, not to the engineman,
but to the telegraph operator. Yet in the same
period seven collisions occurred on lines operated
under the automatic block-signal system, where the
telegraph operators are eliminated. These collisions
were due to misconduct or neglect of enginemen.
It is reasoned from this that the defect in the automatic
block system is that the telegraph operator
is not there to caution the engineman. The presence
of a telegraph operator who attends the signal station<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
serves as a caution to the engineman; whereas,
when the telegrapher is not there, the engineman
is in danger of failing to note the signal. In
other words, the Commission finds the telegrapher
left to himself is unreliable, and the same conclusion
is arrived at in regard to the engineman and
the automatic signals. According to the report, to
obtain the desired security the best-known method
is to rely upon the co&ouml;peration of these three acknowledged
insecurities.</p>

<p>But apart from this consideration, the point for
us railroad men to note is that we have been found
directly and personally responsible for the accidents.
Our failure in duty has been the actual
cause for the loss of life resulting from these collisions.
To say the least, these failures in duty
are very numerous, and the authorities who are
depended upon to look into these matters are of
opinion that &#8220;the block-signal system is the best-known
instrumentality for the prevention of&#8221; these
accidents. But, unfortunately, a great many years
must elapse before the railroads, both single and
double track, can be thoroughly equipped with these
signals, and meanwhile the public must remain at
the mercy of these failures in duty which in the
main, some day, block signals are expected to eliminate.</p>

<p>Working along these lines, however, the progress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
made by the authorities in eliminating the causes
of these accidents and in improving the conditions
has so far been very insignificant. There seems to
be an inclination in all quarters to let things run
their natural course, and to wait for the time when
these accidents shall have become mechanically
impossible.</p>

<p>But the writer of this book has very different
ideas on the subject. He has studied the actual
results that have been obtained from these block-signal
systems, and at the same time he has paid
particular attention to the behavior and responsibility
of the men in regard to these accidents. The
study referred to has not been a matter of a month
or two, but of many years. For unknown reasons
some of my critics have seen fit to question the
nature of my experience as a railroad man. Fortunately
it is an easy matter to give an account of my
qualifications. The mere fact that one has had a
varied and lifelong experience as an engineman or
a conductor would be only partially significant. But
a man who has been a telegraph operator and
towerman for twenty-seven years and part of the
time chief clerk to a railroad superintendent has
certainly some claims to an all-round knowledge
of his subject. The extent of the territory covered
by this experience is even wider than one would
suppose. For a telegraph operator is, of necessity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
one of the best-posted men in the service. He has
occasion to observe, and he is more or less obliged
to understand, nearly every move that an engineman,
conductor, or brakeman has occasion to make
in the routine of his work. He has every opportunity
to observe just how trainmen of all classes
obey the rules and the signals. Add to this opportunity
to become conversant with the practical side
of railroad life, the knowledge that is derived from
attending to the correspondence of a superintendent
and the general work of the office. This includes
supervision of pay-rolls, the hiring and examination
of men, the investigation of accidents, the tracing
of trouble of every description, and the handling
and movements of both freight and passenger trains.
In a general way this has been the nature of my
experience, which I think has been eminently practical
and not &#8220;academic.&#8221; Consequently, although
some of my statements and conclusions may be
questioned by railroad men who have had equal or
greater experience, I nevertheless think that, in the
interests of the public safety, I should be favored
with a full and patient hearing.</p>

<p>Addressing the great body of American railroad
men, I have no hesitation in saying that the service
with which we are connected rests to-day under the
shadow of a great shame. The situation cannot be
looked upon in any other light, and it remains with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
us as a body, and as individuals, to apply the remedy.
In order that my standpoint and the reasons for my
conclusion may be thoroughly understood, I think
it will be profitable, as well as interesting, to give
a short history of the personal investigation and
study which, for many years, I have steadily pursued
in the interests of better and safer railroad
service.</p>

<p>Manifestly, in order to treat my subject in the
widest and fairest manner, all sentimental or personal
scruples must be thrown aside. In explaining
my position I can in no way be a respecter of persons
or traditions. To me the management of a
railroad is merely part of the subject-matter which
I am called upon to consider, and an organization
of railroad men is nothing more or less, so far as
my investigation is concerned, than a combination
of units constituting a certain influence which I
feel myself at perfect liberty to criticise in the interests
of the larger social body represented by the
traveling public. The death roll and the record of
suffering in preventable accidents in the United
States is justification, repeated a hundred times
over, for any and every conceivable probe into personal
conduct or the policy of organizations.</p>

<p>But in holding up the conduct of others to criticism,
it is but reasonable that I should begin with
my own conduct and work in the matter. By what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
methods and means, for example, have I arrived at
the conclusion that on our railroads the interests
of the community have become secondary to those
of the employee and his organization? This, of
course, must be looked upon as a very serious
statement, and it certainly calls for the earnest
consideration of intelligent railroad men. In order
to understand the nature of my evidence on the
subject, it will be necessary to go back with me
to the time when my attention was first directed to
railroad accidents.</p>

<p>In the year 1892 a very serious accident occurred
near the signal tower where I was employed. Although
I was not on duty at the time I was naturally
very much interested in the case, and I paid particular
attention to the evidence that was brought
forward at the hearing in the effort that was made
to hold an engineman responsible for the disaster.</p>

<p>A passenger train, standing at a &#8220;home signal,&#8221;
which was set at danger, was telescoped from the
rear by a freight train, running practically at full
speed. About 1500 feet from the home signal a
distant signal was located. This signal, in the cautionary
position at the time, was a distinct notification
to the freight engineman to proceed cautiously
and to prepare to stop before arriving at the home
signal. An additional reason for such caution arose
from the fact that the night was dark and extremely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
foggy. The explanation of this accident was to me
extremely simple. The signals were all right, and
so were the rules for that matter; but, from one
end of the road to the other, these distant signals
were dead letters. In the daytime, with apparently a
clear track, absolutely no significance was attached
to them; consequently I was not surprised at this
disaster in a fog. But the incident was brought home
to me in such a dreadful way that it started a line
of thought and an investigation into the safety problem
on our railroads, that has lasted until to-day.</p>

<p>But once started in my study, there was no turning
back. Within sight of the interlocking tower
where I worked there was a freight yard of considerable
dimensions; the main lines of the railroad
ran through this yard, and cross-over switches connecting
one side with the other were protected by
what are called yard protection signals. These protection
signals, which are located about 1200 feet
from the cross-overs, must be thrown to the danger
or stop position before the switches can be changed.
Once in a while, however, I noticed that the signal
in question was put up to danger after an engine
had passed, which of course disclosed a very serious
state of affairs, for the engine in question was almost
certain to get into trouble at the cross-overs. Taking
note of this danger, I called it to the attention
of the management. The result was, a rule calling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
for flag protection as well as signal protection at this
particular point, but no attention was paid to other
yards on the system where the conditions were more
or less similar. As a matter of fact, it was not until
a serious wreck had occurred that a general rule on
the subject was put into force. This rule ordered
the employee, after he had placed the signal at the
stop position, to wait a sufficient time to allow a
train that might have passed the signal to arrive at
the cross-overs and thus to proceed in safety.</p>

<p>Now I would like railroad men in general to pay
particular attention to my criticism of their conduct
in relation to this rule and to other illustrations
that follow. Here is a necessary law, put into force
by the management for the safety of travel and the
good of the service. It is a direct appeal to the common
sense and honor of employees. Nevertheless,
in a short time after the order was issued, it was a
dead letter. True, very frequently in clear weather
the rule is absolutely unnecessary; but when the
weather is foggy, or at places where there is a
curve, the failure to observe the rule is liable to result
in a wreck. In one month I was a witness to
eighteen breaches of the rule on a single division
of a railroad.</p>

<p>It must be understood that I am now describing
my actual experience with men, management, and
rules, and the reasons that induced me to follow the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
matter up and to inquire if the work I am describing
can be termed typical of American railroads.</p>

<p>Of course, one of my first thoughts in regard to
the non-observance of rules related to the lack of
adequate supervision by the management. To me
it seemed to be a remarkable fact that I could easily
follow up the working of a rule and the behavior of
the men in regard to it, but the management seldom
did anything of the kind. In this way my field
for investigation became wider and wider, and I
quickly arrived at an idea of the seriousness of the
situation, from the standpoint of the people who
travel from place to place on the cars.</p>

<p>One day a conductor of a freight train came into
my office and asked for a train order which, according
to the rules, called for the signature of both
engineman and conductor. After receiving the order
by telegraph from the train dispatcher, I placed
it on the desk ready for the signatures. A minute or
two later, when I returned from some other work,
I saw that the conductor had signed the order for
himself and the engineman as well. I said to him,
&#8220;That will never do. Not so long ago that trick
killed three trainmen, wrecked two engines, and
cost the company something like $50,000. You
must go for your engineman.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s a great
note,&#8221; the conductor replied. &#8220;You mean to say
you intend to make me walk half a mile and lose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
half an hour in order to get that signature; you are
the first operator who ever picked me up in this
way. Why, they do this thing right along up the
road. If the dispatcher was making a meeting
point it would be different, but it&#8217;s done every day
in the case of a work train or a gravel train.&#8221;
&#8220;That may be very true,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;but you can&#8217;t
do it here; the engineman himself must sign the
order.&#8221; Now this man was actually telling the
truth, and in a very short time I had the proofs in
my possession.</p>

<p>Railroad men who read these lines must remember
that in those days I was simply collecting evidence
in a fair and honorable way, for my own private
purposes, that would enable me to assign some
kind of reason or cause for the lamentable loss of
life on American railroads. I found the railroad
business wherever I went to be bristling with reasons,
and the more I looked into the matter the
greater became my astonishment.</p>

<p>It cannot be claimed that my illustrations apply
to only one or two railroads, for an examination
into these accidents, regardless of locality, will reveal
the fact that almost without exception they
have resulted from the disregard of rules that are
practically similar in nature and intent on all railroads.</p>

<p>In those days, and to a great extent at the present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
time, railroads were equipped with fixed cautionary
signals. On approaching such signals it
became the duty of the engineman to run slowly
and look out. I discovered, in fact it was a matter
of common knowledge and remark, that not one
man in fifty did anything of the kind, although accidents
from the breach of this rule were of daily
occurrence, and the lives of thousands of passengers
and employees had already paid tribute to this disgraceful
state of affairs. To my mind the personal
nature of this general inefficiency was its remarkable
feature. We railroad men were running the
business, and the management and the public got
it into their heads, in some way, that we were doing
our duty. Unfortunately, with the facts before me,
I was unable to console myself with any such delusion.
The nature and variety of the incidents I
was able to discover were most astonishing. While
I certainly dislike to beat the air in this way with
illustrations, the matter of our own personal conduct
and our direct responsibility for these preventable
accidents cannot be sufficiently emphasized.
At any rate, the incidents I am describing must be
taken as the incentive and inspiration I received
for continued exertion.</p>

<p>Furthermore, railroad men are very well aware
that my illustrations cannot be looked upon as ancient
history. Those on the inside still hear of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
strange happenings from day to day. I think a
chapter on narrow escapes would do us railroad
men a power of good. It is surely by taking warning
from them that disasters on the rail can be best
avoided.</p>

<p>Not so long ago on a Western railroad, and about
the same time on a New England railroad as well,
passenger trains were run for miles <i>on the wrong
track against the traffic</i>. This was done in broad
daylight, without orders of any description. The
mere possibility of such occurrences, involving
trainmen from brakemen to enginemen, is almost
unthinkable. With such mental and physical paralysis
to guard against, of what avail are block signals
or the best intentions of a management? The popular
contention that these things occur only &#8220;in
spots&#8221; is most harmful. If only he will do a little
thinking, any railroad man in the country can study
these so-called &#8220;spots&#8221; without wandering an inch
from his own job. The accidents that are liable to
occur when the responsibility can be divided between
the rules and the management are as nothing
compared to those that we railroad men initiate
and blindly invite of our own accord. With all sincerity
and candor I present a final illustration, not
from the past, but from what is positively taking
place at the present day.</p>

<p>As we all know, managers of American railroads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
have been wrestling with the &#8220;hot-box problem&#8221;
for nearly half a century. The rules relating to the
matter are and always have been unmistakable.
&#8220;Take no chances. If necessary, set off the car.&#8221;</p>

<p>On June 17, 1908, a freight train, running fully
thirty miles per hour, approached my signal tower
with a clear right of way east-bound. At the same
time an express passenger train, rushing at full
speed west-bound, came in sight. From a distance
of nearly half a mile I could see that a car on the
freight train was enveloped in smoke and flame
from a hot box. As an actual fact, the engineman,
conductor, and brakemen were aware of it. A brakeman
was on top of the car watching the trouble.
But they were nearing the terminal, and on a parallel
east-bound track there was a train that all
hands were very anxious to pass by or &#8220;jump.&#8221; So,
by common consent, they were taking the chance
on the hot box, and the engineer &#8220;had her wide
open.&#8221; As the freight approached the tower I could
see the chips flying from the ties, which indicated
that the melted journal had snapped in two. A few
seconds later both east- and west-bound tracks were
blocked with the twisted rails, broken ties, and derailed
cars. The passenger train, consisting of
sleepers and crowded coaches, escaped dashing into
the wreck by a miracle,&mdash;that is, by a mere fraction
of time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>This is but an incident in the history of taking
chances. Concealed in it, however, is a personal
lesson that vitally concerns every man in the service.
Do we actually insist upon disaster such as
threatened this passenger train before we can be
persuaded to come to our senses? In this business
of taking chances, which covers every branch of
railroad service, both the traveling public and the
railroad corporations are at our mercy. Through a
long course of years, influence and discipline of all
kinds have utterly failed to check it. It is useless
to talk about &#8220;spots,&#8221; for most of us take chances
systematically. In fact I don&#8217;t think the managements
have any idea of the nature and extent of this
evil, for the reason perhaps that they have made no
special study of the subject nor watched for and
made note of illustrations, as I have. One would
think it would have occurred to some railroad manager
to issue a general order, with a caption somewhat
as follows: &#8220;Here is a list of twenty dangerous
chances which some of you are in the habit of
taking. For goodness&#8217; sake, have a care!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, and elsewhere in this volume, it seems
to me that it is demonstrated, beyond possibility
of question, that thousands of lives have been sacrificed
by reason of the palpable neglect and inefficiency
of certain railroad employees. It makes
not a particle of difference whether we conclude to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
call these careless men a majority, a minority, or
a scattered few. Fundamentally it is also quite a
secondary consideration that rules and methods of
management at times can be shown to be partially
responsible for accidents that result from this inefficient
service. For the time being also, let us
forget that elsewhere I call attention to the conduct
and influence of the railroad labor organizations
as an important factor in the situation, and
to the absolute necessity, under existing conditions,
of governmental interference. Let us put aside all
these considerations, and as thoughtful, well-intentioned
railroad men ask ourselves if we are socially
and morally interested in this safety problem on
American railroads. Do we consider the matter
important enough to give to it more than an occasional
thought or passing comment? When the
lives of our fellow employees, or of passengers, are
sacrificed by reason of personal forgetfulness or
negligence, have we, the principals, or at least those
most nearly concerned in the accidents, any remarks
to make or any suggestions to offer? For the future,
as in the past, are we going to allow this business
to drift? Are we all of the same opinion as the
train-master who said to me: &#8220;What&#8217;s the use of
writing up these matters? We always have had
careless men. We can&#8217;t expect to get rid of them
altogether. Like the poor, they are with us always.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
This man forgot, as many of us are liable to forget,
that &#8220;writing up,&#8221; as they call it, is the only known
method in modern civilization by means of which
enlightenment and education can be passed around
and disseminated.</p>

<p>But let no one imagine that I have any unreasonable
expectations as regards the improvement of
conditions on our railroads. I fully recognize and
make allowance for the difficulties connected with
the problem and for the shortcomings of human
nature, but at the same time I insist that if we only
open our eyes to our personal responsibilities in
the matter, and pay half as much attention to the
public interests as we do to our own, an astonishing
improvement in the service will immediately
result. It is actually a matter of reasonable demonstration
that at least seventy-five per cent of the
casualties might be avoided by increase of interest
on the part of the employee, and the earnest concentration
of his best thought on the subject. This
awakened interest, however, must not be a subordinate
matter. It must be a consecration apart from
and above all questions of wages, discipline, or the
interests of organized labor. There is no question in
my mind as to the efficacy or wonder-working properties
of the personal cure. The real question is,
Are we big enough to undertake the job? If we continue
to avoid the issue, and thus publish the fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
that our social conscience is a blank, we may just
as well write ourselves down as the most self-centred
aggregation of individuals in the industrial
world. It is ridiculous to suppose that conditions
such as I describe in this book can be permitted
to continue much longer. Sooner or later public
opinion will be called upon to define, with no uncertain
emphasis, just how far our private rights can
be permitted to infringe upon our public duties.</p>

<p>But while our apathy in these matters must be
evident to any thoughtful man, it will certainly add
to the impressiveness of the situation if it can be
shown that our conduct differs from, and is altogether
less praiseworthy than that of other men and
other organizations, under very similar conditions.
Is it not remarkable that all over the United States,
business and scientific associations should be actively
bestirring themselves in regard to the railroad
accidents?</p>

<p>The railroad labor organization alone is inactive
and silent in the matter. The railroad business is a
profession, in the operation of which there are certain
features that threaten the public welfare. The
business of a doctor or a surgeon is also a profession,
in which there are many dangers and difficulties
that also relate to the public health and safety.
There is actually no more reason why surgeons
should come together and consult for the good of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
humanity and the honor of their profession, than
there is for railroad men to do so. As a matter of
fact, every profession on earth is jealous of its good
name, and plans early and late for the improvement
of the service it is called upon to render to the
public. In my opinion railroad men should be
equally sensitive to the call of the social conscience.</p>

<p>Of course the discussion of these matters relating
to the personality of railroad men, to be of any
practical value, must be followed by action or experiment
of some kind. Years ago, I proposed to
the managements of several railroads that we, the
men in the operating departments, should be invited
to form a &#8220;Safety League.&#8221; I thought it
would be a good idea to have a badge or button
of some kind. There would then be no doubt in the
public mind as to our interest in the problem. &#8220;Let
us try the experiment,&#8221; I said. &#8220;We can at least
show that there is one division of one railroad in
the United States where the men have come together,
talked over the difficulties, and determined
to make an improvement in the records.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was pointed out to me that the one great
objection to the plan was the fact that leaders
of our organizations would immediately veto anything
of the kind. They have always frowned upon
any such democratic relationship between men and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
management, such as a Safety League would initiate.
It is doubtful, however, if these objections
would stand a little public investigation and pressure,
and therefore I think the present is an opportune
moment to revive the proposition. There
would be no chance for friction between labor men
and management in the efforts of the League to
improve the service. The main object of the League
would be to arouse our interest and concentrate our
attention upon the routine of our daily work, into
which certain factors that imperil the safety of
travel have been allowed to enter. We railroad men
are still too human to render the best service without
a certain amount of emulation and encouragement.
A Safety League could be depended upon
to furnish this much-needed stimulus. If managers
and labor leaders would come out in the open, in the
way I have indicated, and let the public see by this
practical demonstration of their interest that they
are thoroughly in earnest, I am sure they would
find the employees ready and willing to second their
efforts. That a Safety League among American
railroad men would be worth the candle can be
thoroughly comprehended if we give a moment&#8217;s
attention to the endless string of fatalities and the
millions in money losses that are now the recognized
tribute that is being paid to these failures in
duty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>For the rest, to the thoughtful railroad man, a
final word remains to be said:&mdash;</p>

<p>In any comprehensive study of efficiency, prosperity
is one of the most important factors to be
considered. There is always an intimate relationship
between struggle and efficiency. The general
rule is from shirt-sleeves to shirt-sleeves, with prosperity
as the halfway house. In all manner of human
affairs it takes high moral exertion to stave off this
fate. In the railroad business to-day the marked
prosperity and power, political and otherwise, of
the employee, is a positive menace to the safety of
travel, on account of the lack of the moral safeguards
to which I refer. This statement should
not have an irritating effect upon railroad men; it
should stimulate thought. The significance of the
above conclusion is emphasized, from the fact that
our labor leaders appear to be utterly unmindful of
&#8220;the writing on the wall.&#8221; With shorter runs, increase
of pay, larger personal privileges in every
direction, and an ever-widening sphere of power
and influence, a corresponding enlargement of our
appreciation of our social and moral responsibilities
is absolutely essential.</p>

<p>It is obvious, therefore, that the safety problem
in regard to preventable accidents must depend to
a great extent upon the thought which we are now
willing to devote to it. What the managements of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
corporations and the public can do about it without
our assistance can be judged from what they have
been able to accomplish in the past. Up to date we
railroad men have permitted our leaders to do all
our thinking for us. This arises from the fact that
we have never thought about or desired anything
but material advantages; consequently labor leaders
to-day are only too often a reflection of our material
desires and of our lack of social responsibility.
These men are good, bad, or indifferent, according
to the returns we receive from them in cash. In
this way they have been uniformly faithful to our
interests. But we must not forget that we railroad
men, millions of us, are part of the democratic fabric
of the nation, and no democracy can possibly
flourish upon purely materialistic principles.</p>

<p>The matters to which I direct attention in this
volume call for the serious thought of employees,
and let us take for our inspiration the truth that the
democratic idea of government is itself founded upon
the hope that every man will do his own thinking.</p>

THE MEN</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Money</span>, brains, and intelligent labor form the combination
that is attempting to solve the problem of
safe and expeditious transportation on American
railroads. In order to secure the desired result no
expenditure, either of effort or of treasure, is considered
too extravagant. So far as concerns speed
and comfort, the conditions at the present day leave
little to be asked for; but when we come to take
account of the human lives that have paid toll to
American systems of railroading, we cannot avoid
the conclusion that something must be fundamentally
wrong in the methods of handling the traffic.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_035.jpg" width="50%" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A HEAD-ON COLLISION</p>

<p>To account for the unsatisfactory state of affairs,
there are various popular excuses and explanations.
Discussions in regard to block signals, tired employees,
faulty rules, and so forth, are seemingly as
endless as, up to date, they have proved fruitless.
For the most part these discussions are being carried
on by professors and students of economic
conditions and by clever collectors of statistics, but
the men who know all the details of railroad life,
the men who pull the signals and handle the trains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
that are concerned in the trouble, have yet to be
heard from.</p>



<p>However, regardless of the nature or value of
the discussion, the fact remains that we railroad
men still continue in the same blind rut, and there
is no perceptible improvement in efficiency. Managers
and superintendents appear to be helpless in
the matter. They are evidently unable to stem the
tide of preventable casualties.</p>

<p>The story of one accident is the story of them
all. There is a smash-up. Property is destroyed,
perhaps passengers are hurt. The superintendent
at once starts an investigation. It is practically
secret. Not a word in regard to it is allowed to
leak out. After a while a decision is arrived at and
a verdict is rendered,&mdash;in secret. Then discipline
is administered. A private communication containing
verdict and penalty is sent to the accused party.
This, of course, he keeps to himself, and the incident
is closed.</p>

<p>But before long another employee, in utter ignorance
of the first man&#8217;s blunder, commits the same
mistake. Both of these wrecks may have been serious,
perhaps with loss of life, but that makes no
difference. Our traditions and ancient habits have
not been interfered with and the bills have been
paid. Such is discipline in the dark. Great, indeed,
is secrecy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>Yet it is useless to question either the ability or
the integrity of superintendents. As a rule they
have risen from the ranks, and are thoroughly capable
and conscientious. Every avoidable accident is
a reflection on their management, and therefore it
can be taken for granted that they render the best
service possible under the circumstances. But unfortunately
they are beset on all sides with obstacles
and difficulties. What they would like to do, even
in the matter of secrecy and discipline, must frequently
wait upon what they are able to do. Time
was when an offending employee could be discharged
on the spot, without appeal. To-day he
claims a hearing. A brother employee, an expert
on railroad law and precedent, stands at his elbow
as prompter and assistant. In this way, as we railroad
men figure it out, the &#8220;law&#8217;s delay&#8221; puts a
curb on the &#8220;insolence of office.&#8221; Thus the initiative
of a superintendent is held in restraint, and
management by means of schedules and agreements
takes the place of personal direction, while over all
hovers the watchful eye of the grievance committee.
Meanwhile, we, the employees, look on, watching
the game.</p>

<p>When people are killed, when property is wrecked,
we have nothing to say. It is for the management
to figure out reasons and remedies. Of course, as
individuals, we are interested and sorry when accidents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
happen, but personally we do not bestir ourselves,
nor do we call upon our organizations to
bestir themselves in the matter. We simply stand
pat on our rights. If a prominent railroad man is
questioned on the subject of railroad accidents, he
will shrug his shoulders and say, &#8220;Human nature.&#8221;
So far as he is concerned, railroad men are to be
protected, not criticised. If you turn to the management
your errand will be equally fruitless. The
superintendent will have little to say. Generally
speaking, he has no fault to find with the men, and
the men have little fault to find with him. This
seems to be a tacit understanding in the interests
of harmony. It being impossible to move without
treading on somebody&#8217;s toes, by all means let us remain
motionless. As for the public interests, they
must shift for themselves. Consequently, in place of
earnest co&ouml;peration in the interests of efficiency and
improved service, there is something in the nature
of a friendly deadlock between men and management.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of many appearances to the
contrary, the problem of the efficient and safe running
of trains is a very simple one. Fundamentally
it is not a question of rules or safety devices, but
of personal conduct and habits of thought.</p>

<p>In everyday life when a man fails to make a satisfactory
score with a first-class gun we do not place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
the blame on the weapon. If we desire greater efficiency
in marksmanship we direct our attention to
the man. But in the railroad business such commonplace
logic does not seem to apply. When a man
violates an unmistakable rule or runs a signal with
disastrous results, there immediately arises on all
sides a peremptory demand for a different kind of
rule or an improved signal. Public opinion, with
little understanding of the issues at stake, has a constant
tendency to blame systems and managements.
Even the Railroad Commissioners, agreeing with
or responsive to this public sentiment, almost invariably
recommend improvements along these lines.
In this way for many years attention has been concentrated
upon the machinery of management, its
rules and safety appliances, and the personality of
the men has been side-tracked. The injurious effects
of this policy and the manner in which all hands
have conspired to obliterate personality from the
railroad business will be evident from the following
illustration.</p>

<p>A short time ago, in the vicinity of Boston, an express
train telescoped an accommodation passenger
train. The track in question was protected by no
less than four cautionary rules and signals. In this
way the express train received four distinct and emphatic
intimations that a train was on the block
ahead of it. With the slightest attention to the rules<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
or to the dictates of common sense, the protection
was sufficient, yet the train ahead was telescoped
as it was pulling out of a station. Of course, in placing
the responsibility, the plain and real issue in
this case was the question whether the express train
was or was not running slowly and with extreme
caution, as called for by the rules. In order to determine
whether the rules and signals were sufficient
to prevent a collision, it was surely proper and reasonable
to ascertain whether, on this occasion, they
were obeyed. But the Railroad Commissioners,
after an exhaustive investigation, took a different
view of the matter. Their finding or verdict in their
own words was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not necessary to determine whether the
engineman did or did not exercise proper caution;
the significant fact is that the discretion actually
used led to disastrous results. Under the conditions
the signal should have been <i>red</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The harmfulness of this decision will at once be
apparent. It cuts the personality out of the business
at points where obedience to the rules is the vital
issue. Green signals or red signals are equally valueless
if ducks and drakes can be played with the
rules in regard to them. A decision like this one is
confusing and demoralizing to conscientious railroad
men, and it converts the management and discipline
of a railroad into a thing of shreds and patches.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>To emphasize this point, it should be added that
another collision of a similar nature took place about
the same time on the same railroad. An express
passenger train approached a fixed signal which indicated
<i>caution</i>. The engineman, on the lookout, but
with the caution up his sleeve, kept on his way
without any reduction in speed. A moment later he
encountered a red fusee which called for an absolute
stop, but it was too late. Neither the fusee nor the
flagman frantically waving his red flag availed to
arrest the momentum of the flyer, which dashed
into the rear of another passenger train standing
at a station.</p>

<p>Now, with all deference to the Railroad Commissioners,
the &#8220;significant facts&#8221; in these accidents
are the personal conduct of the employees and not
the nature of the signals or the wording of the
rules.</p>

<p>Of course, taking a wider view of preventable accidents,
it is always an easy matter to divide the
responsibility for them between the men and the
management. This is the usual and popular method
of treating the subject. But the idea, reasonable at
times, has been overworked, and has now degenerated
into a principle that responsibility should always
be divided. Consequently, while we are busy
adjusting the division, we frequently lose sight of the
real issues, and the offenders are allowed to escape.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>Fundamentally, then, it must be confessed, we
railroad men are to blame for these preventable accidents.
Most of the trouble can be directly traced
to our own personal behavior, that is to say, to our
conduct and habits of thought as railroad men.
This is by no means a reflection on our character
as sympathetic and reasonable human beings. Our
intentions are all right, but our training in the railroad
business has been all wrong.</p>

<p>But it is of little use to talk or write about personality
in the abstract. As practical men dealing
with a practical topic, we must follow the railroad
man out on the road, we must watch him at his
work, and we must take notice of the common sense,
the caution, and the good judgment or otherwise,
which he habitually displays in the execution of his
duties. Then, and not until then, can we expect to
become qualified to place our opinions or conclusions
on record.</p>

<p>Now the regulations relating to the running and
protection of trains are very similar on all railroads,
and therefore the following rule taken from one of
our current working time-tables may be looked
upon as thoroughly representative.</p>

<p>&#8220;A freight train must not leave a station to follow
a passenger train until five minutes after the
departure of said passenger train.&#8221;</p>

<p>To any ordinary thinker this rule will appear to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
be plain, positive, and for the most part necessary.
Yet as a matter of fact no attention whatever is
paid to it either by enginemen, by conductors, or
for that matter by superintendents. Its violation
has been the cause of collisions and loss of life, but
that does not seem to bother us, for we continue to
disregard it. Let us take another illustration.</p>

<p>At the point where the writer has been employed
for many years, there is a junction of four-track and
two-track systems. The rule for the handling of
trains at this point is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;All trains will approach and enter upon four-track
sections under complete control.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is nothing misleading or uncertain about
this rule. The instructions to enginemen are positive.
The towermen at these points understand how
necessary and important this rule is. Besides, it is
the written result of the experience of the officials.
Nevertheless, it is totally and consistently ignored
by enginemen. But enginemen are not alone to
blame. Conductors should at least be conversant
with the rules. The railroad officials who ride on
these trains might also very reasonably be expected
to notice the persistent violation of regulations for
which they themselves are responsible. Yet even
the trains bearing the Railroad Commissioners will
rush over the territory in question as fast as the
wheels can turn. The conditions and the rules in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
this case are practically the same as were those at
Salisbury, England, at the time of the recent disaster
in that city.</p>

<p>Now as it seems to me, the all-important facts in
these cases do not relate to the nature of the rules,
nor even to their non-enforcement, but to the downright
neglect of railroad men to do as they are told.
For, granted observance of them, all other questions
in regard to the rules dissolve into thin air.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the rules I have quoted and the
interpretation put upon them by railroad men cannot
be taken as examples standing alone, for they
are merely illustrations of a principle that covers the
whole cautionary field in our railroads. In some
way we have got it into our heads that these rules
are <i>permissive</i>, not <i>positive</i>. This permissive principle
means the exercise of our own judgment
according to circumstances, regardless of the rule.
Acting under the influence of this principle, the
flagman protects his train to the very letter of the
rule when it is manifestly necessary, but when, in
his opinion, it is not, he takes chances. In this way
he forms a habit of using his own judgment in regard
to a positive rule. Sooner or later this means
a preventable accident.</p>

<p>The engineman encounters a single torpedo.
According to his rules, he should bring his train to
a full stop. But as he happens to have a clear track<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
for a mile ahead of him he keeps on. He, too, forms
a habit which has to be reckoned with some day.</p>

<p>Again, all trainmen understand that an express
train has no business to run past a station while
accommodation trains are discharging passengers.
It is by no means an uncommon occurrence, however,
to see an express train disregard these positive
instructions, on the strength of hand motions given
by trainmen on the accommodation train to the
effect that they are about to start, and that the way
is safe and clear for the flyer. Yet in this manner
accidents happen, and passengers from the accommodation
are always likely to be caught in a trap
between the trains.</p>

<p>But the dangerous and widespread effects of the
permissive principle applied to important rules will
be appreciated to the full when we study the interpretation
which railroad men in general are in the
habit of applying to the word <i>caution</i>.</p>

<p>On all railroads there are certain fixed signals
for the guidance and information of employees.
When caution is called for, the light is usually green
and the semaphore horizontal. Now, as the writer
looks at it, when any signal indicates <i>caution</i>, it is
not to be looked upon as a permissive or conditional
signal to be interpreted at will by different enginemen.
According to the rules and to common sense
when a train, at the time a cautionary signal is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
sighted, is running thirty or forty miles an hour, it
calls for a positive and not a theoretical reduction
in speed. The cautionary signal is not merely a
piece of information to be stowed away in the brain
of the enginemen, to be utilized when a rear end or
a broken rail is sighted.</p>

<p>Although for a number of years the inflexible
enforcement of the rules relating to these cautionary
signals has been advocated, yet to-day train after
train will run past these semaphores and green lights
without any reduction in speed, provided the track
ahead of them is seen to be clear.</p>

<p>Here we tackle the very heart of the matter, for
in so far as the rules and common sense are concerned,
it should not make a particle of difference
to the engineman whether the track ahead is or is
not known to be clear of trains; his instructions
call for cautious running, and by no possible interpretation
or juggling with words can cautious running,
or running under control, be taken to mean
running at full speed. Yet in the way I have indicated
the cancer of a very dangerous habit has been
allowed to grow into the American system of managing
trains. This wrong interpretation of the word
<i>caution</i> by enginemen and others has without a
shadow of doubt during the past few years cost the
corporations thousands upon thousands of dollars
and multitudes of human lives. For if railroad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
managers labor under the delusion that enginemen
can run <i>cautiously at full speed</i> when the track is
clear, and avoid disaster when from unforeseen
reasons another train happens to be on the same
section, they are very much mistaken.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, then, the permissive principle
covers the whole field of railroad life, and is a
constant menace alike to the interests of the corporations
and to those of the traveling public. As a
matter of fact, we, the employees, are bigger than
the rules. According to our way of thinking, it is
not alone necessary that a rule should be plain and
sound from a general standpoint, but its downright
meaning and necessity must also be evident in each
and every particular instance. If it fails to stand
this test, we consider ourselves at liberty to use our
judgment in regard to it.</p>

<p>Illustrations of the danger that lurks in this permissive
principle can be multiplied indefinitely. But,
after all, it is only a link in the chain, for there are
other features in the personality of railroad men
that call for serious attention.</p>

<p>The other day, within a few miles of Boston, an
express passenger train approached a railroad crossing
at grade. For some reason the gate-tender was
negligent and failed to lower the gates. By reason
of just such negligence, teams are frequently struck
and lives are lost at these crossings. On all railroads,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
the rules are quite plain and unmistakable in regard
to such matters. It is the duty of the engineman to
report the incident to the management. As a matter
of fact on this particular occasion the engineman
failed to do so. He failed to appreciate the
fact that the safety of the public at these crossings
is altogether dependent upon the strict observance
of the rules. He had scruples and emotional objections,
perhaps, to reporting this gate-tender, and
rather than do so he took all the chances in connection
therewith, chief among which is the simple
fact that on a railroad unchecked negligence can
be depended upon to breed disaster.</p>

<p>That railroad men in general are either indifferent
to or ignorant of the importance of the above
fundamental fact will be made still clearer by another
illustration. On September 16, 1907, that is, on the
day following the disaster at West Canaan, N. H.,
the writer was a witness of the violation of two most
important rules by a number of enginemen, conductors,
and brakemen. A switch leading from the
west- to the east-bound main line was left open
while an express passenger train was passing inward
bound. A freight train was on the west-bound
track waiting to back over. Two minutes later, <i>with
his train only halfway in to clear the main line</i>, the
engineman on the freight whistled in his flagman
in the face of an accommodation passenger train<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
which had followed the express. From beginning
to end, on the permissive principle, it was a perfectly
safe transaction, for there was a mile of straight
track in both directions; but the rules for the running
of the trains and for the safety of the public
were violated. The witnesses were seven or eight
veteran railroad men, who looked upon the affair
as perfectly proper and justifiable under the circumstances.
It never entered the heads of these men
that the affair should be reported to the management.
That some of the best men in the service
should behave in this way, as it were in the very
shadow of the accident at West Canaan, is almost
inconceivable. Of course, if these incidents stood
by themselves their significance might be comparatively
trifling; but as a matter of fact they are
illustrations of a condition which is thoroughly
typical of American railroads. This condition or
situation may be briefly yet correctly outlined as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is practically <i>no out-on-the-road supervision</i>
on American railroads.</p>

<p>Railroad managers depend upon the reports of
employees for information in regard to violations of
rules. But employees do not, and cannot be compelled
to, report their associates; consequently negligence
of all kinds is practically unchecked.</p>

<p>Finally: unchecked negligence can be shown to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
be the root and direct cause of nearly all preventable
accidents, and loss of life therefrom, on American
railroads.</p>

<p>Here we have a conclusion worth looking into.
At a glance we perceive that negligence is the
prime and fundamental fact. It is the direct cause
of the trouble. The fact that the negligence is <i>unchecked</i>
is important, yet secondary. It should be
treated as a separate issue, and it must stand or fall
on its own merits.</p>

<p>But our conclusion that accidents result in almost
all cases from unchecked negligence should be supported
by evidence and proof. For examples in support
of it, let us take two of the most disastrous
wrecks in the history of New England railroads.</p>

<p>On November 26, 1905, at Baker Bridge in Lincoln,
Mass., seventeen people were killed and thirty
injured. An express passenger train was following
an accommodation train, which was somewhat late.
Cautionary signals calling for reduced speed and
careful running were passed at intervals by the express
train, but, according to the evidence, the
engineman paid no attention to them; hence the
accident. Now the habitual negligence in regard to
these cautionary signals was a matter of common
knowledge. In fact, attention was called to the
matter both before and after the accident by the
writer. The unchecked negligence in this particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
case was therefore directly responsible for the accident
and the loss of life.</p>

<p>Again, on September 15, 1907, at West Canaan,
N. H., twenty-five people were killed and forty injured.
The unchecked negligence in this case is by
no means so striking as in the previous example,
and yet the evidence pointing in that direction is
quite as significant. A mistake occurred in the
transmission of an important train order. This mistake
was the direct cause of the accident. For various
reasons it was impossible to say by whom the
mistake was made.</p>

<p>Now let us turn to our book of rules and take
note of the following instructions to train dispatchers
and operators: &#8220;In transmitting messages write
slowly and firmly,&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>With all proper consideration for hard-worked
and conscientious train dispatchers, I am compelled
to confess that train orders are seldom if ever sent
&#8220;slowly and firmly.&#8221; Operators will bear me out in
the statement that orders are transmitted by dispatchers
as fast as the men can handle them. That
is to say, between veterans in the business they are
rattled off at the highest limit of speed. The men
concerned in the accident at West Canaan were
veterans. Had the man at West Canaan been a
&#8220;plug,&#8221; that is, a green hand, in all probability the
accident would not have occurred. While, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
this is merely a supposition, yet the fact remains
that the men would have been transmitting <i>slowly
and firmly, and the chances for a mistake would
have been reduced to a minimum</i>.</p>

<p>I thoroughly understand and appreciate the difficulties
with which the train dispatcher has to contend.
I am quite aware that he is called upon to
handle trains with the utmost dispatch; nevertheless,
I insist that, in order to reduce chances of
accident to a minimum, train orders should in all
cases be transmitted slowly and firmly. I stand by
the rules. The issue is between speed and safety,
and in all cases the latter should be given the right
of way.</p>

<p>Thoughtful railroad men, who understand the
situation on the railroads at the present day, are
yet very slow in suggesting remedies. They say,
&#8220;It is up to the management to enforce the rules.&#8221;
On the other hand, if a superintendent can be persuaded
to express an opinion he will retort, &#8220;It is
up to the men to obey the rules. They are plain
enough and sufficient for the purpose, but we cannot
station a spy at every switch to make sure that
the rules are obeyed. We have to depend on the personality
and general intelligence of our employees.&#8221;</p>

<p>It will, I think, be evident from the facts and
conditions that we have been considering, that
whatever secondary causes there may be for preventable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
railroad accidents, the trainmen themselves
hold the key to the situation. They are at
liberty to obey the rules, and thus solve the problem
in the only way in which it ever can be solved;
or, they can continue to place upon these rules a
wrong interpretation, and thus evade their manifest
meaning and purpose. As matters stand to-day between
labor organizations and railroad managers, it
is very doubtful if by any practical system of supervision
or discipline the rules for the safe and efficient
running of trains can in all cases and at all
times be adequately enforced. Thus the whole
business resolves itself into a personal matter with
us as conscientious railroad men. Singly and collectively,
it is up to us to do the square thing, if
necessary, in spite of the management.</p>

<p>As the case stands to-day, we railroad men are
in a class by ourselves. We are well-paid, well-treated,
well-educated, and well-organized. In all
that pertains to our material well-being we compare
more than favorably with any other class of workers
in the country; but considered as responsible individuals
intrusted with the care of railroad property
and the safety of the traveling public, our records are
very unsatisfactory. The truth of this conclusion
is not open to question. We cannot escape from
the statistics and the figures; and, day by day, the
evidence against us continues to accumulate.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>There are many people who think that the intelligence
and education of the twentieth-century railroad
man can be depended upon to guard against
the shortcomings to which I have called attention.
On the contrary, I am inclined to think that the
intellectual independence of the railroad men is in
itself a danger to be guarded against. Standing by
itself, the statement that knowledge is power is a
fallacy. Knowledge is only a means. Its benefit to
any one is always an open question. In other words,
the secret of power is in the application of knowledge.
Thus when we analyze a modern railroad
accident we are forced to the conclusion that many
railroad men take chances by reason of the supreme
confidence which they possess in their own cleverness
and ability to deal with an emergency, however
sudden. This resourceful characteristic of
Americans is a splendid thing from a general standpoint,
but in the railroad business it has its stern
limitations. Only too many of our accidents are illustrations,
not of lack of knowledge or resource,
but of the downright misapplication of these intellectual
features. In some cases we find an over-supply
of self-confidence, in others a disinclination to
knuckle right down to the observance of plain and
positive instruction. In such cases a man cannot be
called the fortunate possessor of intellectual advantages,
but their manifest victim.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>Railroad managers, therefore, sooner or later will
come to understand that the one thing needed in
the railroad business at the present day is to educate
employees to appreciate the fact that successful
and safe railroading in the future will have to
depend, not upon the multiplication of safety devices
or the reconstruction of rules, but upon the personal
effort and conduct of conscientious, alert, and
careful men.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thought counts; and it is a good idea
for practical railroad men to look into and study
these problems, each according to his ability and
the light that is in him.</p>

THE MANAGEMENT</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> problem of safety in railroad travel has been
discussed, from widely different points of view, by
many conscientious investigators. The methods of
these writers in marshaling facts and drawing conclusions
are usually identical. The formula consists
of a variety of accidents, a variety of causes, and a
variety of possible or proposed remedies. For results,
up to date, we have a library of information,
but not a suspicion of improvement, in the record
of preventable fatalities. Meanwhile, in the public
mind there is confusion of ideas and considerable
doubt as to the practical outcome of all this discussion.
This is a natural state of affairs, for the reason
that the only factor in the situation which is constant,
and about which there is no difference of
opinion, is the impotency of railroad people in coping
with the difficulties.</p>

<p>Now, after all that has been spoken and written
on the subject of efficient and safe railroad service,
the problem remains, as at the beginning, essentially
personal, social, and ethical in its nature.
Nearly all questions in regard to it must, sooner or
later, be thought out in this direction by railroad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
employees and managers. We may continue to
work over and reconstruct our rules and to multiply
our safety devices until we compel trains to creep
from station to station; yet the problem will remain
unsolved, the needless and disgraceful sacrifice
of life will continue, until trainmen, enginemen,
and managers put their heads together and agree
to adopt a new code of railroad morals. My meaning
when I allude to railroad morals should be
clearly understood.</p>

<p>On nearly all railroads a given rule is obeyed at
one point and disregarded at another, on account
of different sets of conditions. This conduct leads to
accidents when men who have habitually disobeyed
the regulations at points where such action is harmless
undertake to behave in the same way under
conditions when a strict observance of the rules is
vitally important. Generally speaking, managers
are cognizant of this state of affairs, and thus in a
measure they are morally to blame for it; but I do
not think that they realize the extent of the evil,
for the reason that any organized out-of-door supervision
is unknown, and thus the report of an accident,
that is to say, the result of these practices, is
usually the first and only information on the subject
that reaches the manager&#8217;s office. The blame
for accidents that happen in this way cannot be
said to rest upon any particular class of employees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
or to depend upon their intelligence or length of
service. Among the culprits you will find some of
the oldest and most experienced men as well as
some of the greenest. This goes to show that the
trouble is inherent in the system, and a part of the
everyday life and character of armies of railroad
men.</p>

<p>But in a straightforward investigation of this
nature it is particularly desirable to get hold of all
the facts that can be used in any way to throw
light on the situation, and there is only one method,
as yet untried, for properly securing and emphasizing
these facts. Let us call this the confessional
method. In the hands of a competent witness it
can be depended upon to furnish us with all the information
necessary for a thorough comprehension
of our subject. This confessional method has nothing
to conceal. It has no axe to grind, no interests
to protect. It is born of a heartfelt appreciation of
the seriousness of the situation on our railroads.
Mindful of the ever-increasing and lamentable loss
of life caused by the unstudied indifference and
negligence of employees, as well as by the blindness
of the authorities to the real issues and dangers,
it approaches and takes hold of the problem somewhat
in the spirit of the King in &#8220;Hamlet,&#8221; when
in an agony of remorseful retrospection he exclaimed,
&#8220;Try what repentance can: what can it not?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>That there is an urgent call for this confessional
method of supplying the facts in this railroad business
is capable of easy demonstration. When an
accident takes place on a railroad, some kind of an
explanation or reason for its occurrence is immediately
called for. Consequently there is a lining up
of opposing interests. A certain management has
to be vindicated, certain employees to be defended.
In the investigation that follows, an array of facts
defensive and otherwise is brought forward in the
interests of the opposing parties; but evidence and
facts that are likely to reflect on both men and
management, and perhaps on the handling of the
case or of other cases by the Board of Railroad
Commissioners, are studiously avoided. The facts
that are suppressed in this way usually contain the
heart of the whole business, and are the very
points in which the public is profoundly interested.
An illustration in point will make this doubly
clear.</p>

<p>About a year ago, in an accident near Troy, N. Y.,
five passengers were killed and many were injured.
A special passenger train crashed into the rear of
a regular passenger train. There is a sharp curve
in the track a short distance above the scene of the
collision. Had the special been handled carefully
round this curve instead of recklessly, the accident
would not have occurred. Caution, of course, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
necessary in running round sharp curves, and the
rules on all railroads are plain and emphatic on the
subject. But the authorities who investigated this
accident treated it as an isolated instance of individual
carelessness. Within a period of six months
these gentlemen are called upon to pass judgment
on probably twenty wrecks, every one of them bearing
the same earmarks of disobedience as this disaster
near Troy, yet no one ever dreams of hunting
up a common cause for dozens of accidents that are
exactly similar and brought about in the same way.
To be precise, this accident at Troy was the result
of a habit. At a glance we perceive that the public
is a hundred times more likely to be interested in
the uprooting of such a bad habit as running recklessly
round curves than it is in placing the responsibility
or punishing the offender in any particular
instance. Yet who ever heard of a verdict that
placed the blame for an accident on a habit? The
reasons for the oversight are obvious. A dangerous
habit, long continued and unchecked, is a decided
reflection on men and management, and, indeed,
on the Railroad Commissioners, whose vigilance it
has escaped; and consequently no evidence or facts
in regard to these bad habits are ever permitted to
find their way into investigations. It will be evident,
therefore, that the confessional method can
be profitably employed in supplying a few missing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
links in our knowledge of actual conditions and
methods of operation on the railroads.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_063.jpg" width="50%" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A YARD WRECK</p>

<p>To begin with, it will be well to take note of an
estimate, made after a careful study of the figures,
that fully eighty-five per cent of the fatalities that
occur on our railroads can be directly traced to the
negligence of employees. Regardless of the accuracy
of this estimate, it certainly points to a very
serious state of affairs. In studying the nature of
these accidents and the conditions under which they
take place, one cannot help being impressed with
the fact that almost every possible way in which
trouble can occur on a railroad is foreseen and provided
for by some rule or safety device. So carefully
has the ground been studied and worked over,
that in every case of preventable accident it can
almost be taken for granted that an employee is to
blame. That is to say, the management of a railroad
is always found to be impregnably protected
by the rules and regulations from any direct responsibility.
But, after all, this is only one side of
the shield, for clearly the moral responsibility of a
railroad manager cannot be said to cease with the
printing of a batch of rules or the erection of a system
of signals. It is not only necessary that rules
should be plain and sufficient in themselves to prevent
accidents, it is also equally essential that reasonable
and systematic efforts should be exerted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
to enforce them. On a railroad, as elsewhere, the
means employed for the supervision of personal
conduct and for the enforcement of necessary
rules are all included in the term discipline. Without
some organized and effective system of discipline
no industrial establishment of any kind can
be successfully administered. On railroads in particular,
the department of discipline is intimately
related to the interests of the traveling public. Let
us then examine in a practical manner the nature
and methods of the discipline that is in force at the
present day on what may be considered the most
important railroad in New England. A little personal
experience will throw the necessary light on
the subject.</p>



<p>Some time ago, happening to notice that important
regulations were being habitually ignored by a
certain class of employees, the writer called the
attention of the management to the matter. In
this way, from time to time, many cases of simple
negligence, which had no serious consequences,
were reported to superintendents. Thinking it all
over, the writer finally became anxious to find out
just what disposition was made of these reports.
For it must be apparent to any thinking person
that the practical value of any system of discipline
must always depend upon the efforts that are put
forth and the success that is achieved in checking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
and in preventing the repetition of these instances
of what may be called trouble in the bud. The reports
to which I refer were acknowledged by the
management, and there the matter ended. But as
I happened to be studying the subject at the time
in a systematic manner, I was by no means satisfied
with this abrupt conclusion. So I made an investigation
on my own account, and easily discovered
that practically all other interested employees were
unaware of and had not been notified in regard to
the violation of these rules because, as the men explained,
nothing had happened. That is to say, it
was necessary to hurt somebody or smash up a few
carloads of freight before any efforts could be exerted
according to the rules to put a stop to the
negligence. This became very clear to me, when,
upon making further inquiries, I was informed that
the men had been disciplined to the full extent of
the rules. Now my object in the investigation was
not to get at the nature or the amount of the discipline,
but simply to be able to arrive at an estimate
of its value in checking and restraining others
from committing similar mistakes. In this way I
soon arrived at the conclusion that a system of discipline
that works in the dark in this way is of no
practical value whatever. It is a weakness of management,
which positively undermines the operating
department and leads the way to all sorts of disaster<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
and loss of life. Its continued existence in practical
railroad management is a standing menace to the
safety of the traveling public. As a matter of fact,
lives are still being frequently sacrificed and much
property is almost daily being destroyed as direct
tribute to this incomprehensible system of discipline.</p>

<p>The exact method by which this system is put
into operation, and the regulations which govern
employees in regard to it, will be understood from
the following extracts from general orders on the
subject, issued by what is sometimes considered one
of the best-managed railroads in the country:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The System of Discipline by Record having
proved beneficial both to the road and to employees,
it has been decided to extend the same by the addition
of merit marks....</p>

<p>&#8220;Each employee will be promptly notified of unfavorable
entries made in the record book opposite
his name. He will upon request be shown his record
at any time, but will not be permitted to see the
record of another person.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Bulletins, omitting name, date, train, and location</i>,
but containing facts and conclusions and such
comment as is applicable, will be issued from time
to time if considered necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>The significance of this general order to employees
should be thoroughly understood. Practically
interpreted, it means that when an employee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
commits a mistake or is guilty of negligence that
endangers life and property, the affair is to be
looked upon as a secret. This interpretation is correct
according to the actual operation of the system
on the railroads. Neither in the interests of the
public safety nor for any other reason can the facts
in the case, as regards date, name, location, and
train, be utilized or published for the prevention
of future accidents of a similar nature. This is the
law of the road, and while it remains in force any
employee can claim the full benefit of its provisions.
The practical illustration in my own experience
given above is fully explained and accounted for
by this general order. But the most astonishing
feature in relation to it is that with the records
before us it should continue to be considered and
heralded as &#8220;beneficial&#8221; either to the railroads or
the employees, not to mention the public. For a
full explanation of this peculiar state of affairs we
must turn to another quarter.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that the American railroad
man, the trainman and engineman in particular,
has deep-rooted objections to being &#8220;posted&#8221;
in any way. We have consistently emphasized our
objections from the time, years ago, when our likes
and dislikes first began to cut a figure in the plans
of the management. So to-day we are prepared to
go to almost any extreme rather than submit to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
any system of discipline that will publish our mistakes
and advertise us personally by name as examples,
even although such action can be shown
to be absolutely indispensable for the proper safeguarding
of life and property. With all the facts
against us, we think we can be trusted to render
the best service and to live up to the rules without
the assistance of publicity in any form. We consider
discipline to be a private matter, to be settled
between ourselves and the management; and thus
the workings of the system have been arranged
without any reference whatever to its effect on the
interests of the millions of people whose lives are
placed in jeopardy by its arrangements. As a matter
of fact, then, the system of discipline which I
have described is the result of long-continued pressure
and consequent concessions by the management
to the demands of employees. These concessions
have been granted for the most part in the
interests of harmony. What the exact nature of
this force or pressure is, which, acting on behalf of
railroad employees, has been able to influence railroad
legislation and management to the total exclusion
of the public interests, calls for the closest
investigation.</p>

<p>A short time ago, in a report issued by the New
York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, President
Mellen stated that so far as his system of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
roads was concerned, increase of pay had invariably
been followed by decreased efficiency. Mr. Mellen,
of course, has the reports and the figures to substantiate
his opinion. The statement is plain enough,
although its meaning is somewhat obscure. That
decrease in efficiency has been the natural sequence
and effect of higher wages, or that men lose interest
in their callings or grow more careless in their
habits with every addition to their material prosperity,
is manifestly absurd. Mr. Mellen has not
informed us that he looks upon the matter in this
light, although his words may reasonably be considered
to bear some such interpretation. Be this as
it may, he certainly calls attention to a very uncomfortable
coincidence. In effect Mr. Mellen&#8217;s words
may be taken as a direct challenge to railroad men
to come forward and explain a state of affairs that
has the appearance of being very much to their
discredit. The implied challenge can be immediately
and concisely replied to in this way. The
efficiency of the service rendered by employees to
the New Haven road has by no means been impaired
or decreased by any consideration of wages
whatsoever. Nevertheless, the power or pressure
that induced Mr. Mellen and other railroad managers
to add large sums to their pay-rolls is also
responsible, by the exercise of its influence in other
directions, for the decreased efficiency. <i>Increase of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
pay and decrease of efficiency are both indications of
loss of grip by the management.</i> Hidden away in this
simple statement there is a whole world of significance.
Here are fundamental facts, from a fearless
consideration of which we shall be able to derive a
logical and clean-cut explanation of the present situation
on American railroads.</p>

<p>The force or influence to which I call attention
is of course the Railroad Labor Organization. But
it should be clearly understood that my conclusions
in regard to these unions are not to be taken
as a reflection on their character and work while
acting in legitimate channels. The debt we railroad
men owe to our organizations admits no question.
The beneficial results are before us in almost
every department of the railroad business. They
have established a fraternal feeling among us. On
all sides they have aroused a spirit of mutual helpfulness.
They have also succeeded in advancing
wages, and in this way contributed to the comfort
and prosperity of almost every man in the service.
Furthermore, they have been particularly active in
inciting legislation for the protection of life and
limb among workers. These facts must not be forgotten
or minimized, for they are worthy of all
commendation. But in this matter of the personal
conduct and efficiency of railroad men in relation
to these terrible railroad accidents, we have first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
of all to consider the paramount interests of society;
and while humanity has no quarrel with the
unions while they attend to their legitimate business,
it certainly can be said to have a grievance
against them that calls for prompt attention and
remedy. This grievance consists in the fact that,
for a great many years, the influence of the railroad
labor organizations has been consistently exerted,
not only to raise wages and to improve conditions,
which of course is perfectly proper and
justifiable, but also to nullify discipline, to destroy
personal management and authority, and to obliterate
from all schedules and working agreements
any reference to or consideration for the paramount
interests of the traveling public. It is not necessary
to quote paragraphs from these agreements,
which for the most part are secret documents.
Given two angles of a triangle, it is an easy matter
to calculate the dimensions of the third. Similarly,
given the actual conduct of the men and the
behavior of the management in relation to it, we
can derive very accurate conclusions in regard to
the work and power of the organizations.</p>

<p>Yet let no one imagine that this interference
with the management in the matter of discipline
is brought about by design or is directly intentional.
On the contrary, in a very natural way, it
has grown out of a system whose main object has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
been to secure justice and equal rights for every
individual employee. But unfortunately, in pursuing
these personal ends and objects, the rights of
the community have been forgotten. It is easy to
demonstrate that in the railroad business this fair
play to the individual frequently means a sacrifice
of the public interests. In the operating department
of a railroad, illustrations of this point meet us at
every turn.</p>

<p>In any ordinary business establishment there is
at all times a certain amount of weeding going on
for the good of the business. This is done on the
personal judgment and initiative of the manager.
In this way a high average of efficiency is attainable
in all departments. But in the railroad business
no such personal action on the part of a superintendent
would be tolerated for a minute. It is
surely reasonable that among the thousands of men
who enlist in the railroad ranks there will be many
who after a while will give evidence of unfitness for
the service. Regardless of the power of the superintendent
in theory, these men, if they are members
of an Order or Brotherhood, <i>must actually hurt
somebody or do considerable damage to property, before
they can be removed</i>. That is to say, there is
no elimination of weak spots until something happens.
But this is not all. When a vacancy occurs
in the service, it is immediately advertised, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
oldest bidder in point of service takes the position.
In some of the agreements with the management
the seniority rule is said to be absolute, in others
it is modified by the clause, &#8220;with the approval of
the superintendent.&#8221; But in a business of the nature
of a railroad the public interests demand that
at all points the best available man should be in
charge, regardless of his length of service or his
rights as an individual. But the labor organizations
do not permit the public interests or those of the
corporation to interfere with what they consider to
be the just and inalienable rights of each and every
employee. Applied to the railroad business, the fixed
principle that every man shall take his turn is fundamentally
wrong and demoralizing. It is one of
the wedges that are being used to destroy personal
supervision and management and to substitute management
by machine methods. In my opinion its
tendency is in the interests of poor service. Healthy
competition in good behavior is almost obliterated,
while honest ambition and <i>esprit de corps</i> get very
little encouragement. It has the general effect of
removing the attention of employees from the management
and concentrating it steadfastly upon the
organization, that is to say, upon the source from
which increase of pay and all other blessings are
expected to flow.</p>

<p>Of course, I cannot expect railroad managers to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
agree at all points with my estimate of their powers
and functions, or of the helpless situation in which
they now find themselves. Just at present, however,
I am not interested in opinions from any quarter.
The facts that interest me, and I think the public
as well, relate to what these railroad managers have
done in the past and are actually doing at the present
day, with such powers as they possess, in the
interest of safe and efficient railroad service. It may
be very interesting to be informed that a superintendent
has the power promptly to discharge an
engineman for running a danger signal and placing
the lives of five hundred passengers in utmost peril,
but it is much more to the point to impress upon
the public mind that the action of the official will
not amount to a snap of his finger if an organization
puts down its foot and signifies its opinion to the
contrary. Illustrations of these facts are not far
to seek. Only a short time ago an engineman was
promptly discharged for disregarding a signal in a
most inexcusable manner. The case was passed up
higher for the approval of the general manager.
Meanwhile the man had discovered some kind of
an excuse for his action, and a committee was appointed
to look into the matter. There being a total
difference of opinion between the management and
the grievance committee, the heads of different
organizations were summoned from some western<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
city to help straighten out the deadlock. After a
while the man was put back on his engine, and
the report passed round that the case had been settled
in this way in the interests of harmony. No
wonder the superintendent who was concerned in
the matter threw up his hands in disgust and exclaimed,
&#8220;What&#8217;s the use?&#8221;</p>

<p>This method of interfering with the regular
course of discipline may perhaps be proper and
commendable in a cigar factory or a cotton mill,
but on a railroad, where the lives of countless people
are dependent upon obedience to the rules, its effect
upon the service is absolutely fatal. But unhappily
this is not the whole story, for it must be confessed
that the public frequently joins hands with the
organizations in defeating the ends and aims of
discipline. After some of the worst and most inexcusable
accidents that have ever occurred on New
England railroads, petition has followed petition
into the railroad offices with the expressed object
of influencing the management to reinstate men in
the service who have been convicted of inefficiency
or unpardonable carelessness. Of course a superintendent
should thoroughly investigate every case
on its merits, but the verdict of the management
should be final. The wisdom of this policy might
be questioned if superintendents were political
appointees or owed their positions to &#8220;graft&#8221; or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
&#8220;pull.&#8221; As a matter of fact these men are among
the hardest worked, most thoroughly capable and
conscientious men in the United States. No combination
of opinion from the public, the railroad
commissioners, and the labor organizations is half
as likely to be just and impartial as the individual
judgment of the superintendent on the spot. The
following significant remark by one of those gentlemen
may well be taken to heart by the public as
well as by employees: &#8220;With a free hand, we could
put a stop to this killing in a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>The story of railroad management is now before
us, and the record of accidents all over the United
States is the price that is being paid for it. As I
have described the situation, the circle of cause and
effect is now complete. Beginning with the negligence
of employees, which must be considered as
the primary cause of these accidents, I next took
up the matter of discipline, whose function it is to
control and put a stop to this negligence. The system
was found to be altogether inadequate and
useless. Finally, I attempted to demonstrate that
the labor organizations are responsible for the
nature of this discipline, and thus indirectly for the
accidents that have resulted from its inefficiency.
Systems of discipline vary on different roads;
nevertheless these contentions are sound and universally
applicable, for the blight of interference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
with the management has in greater or less degree
withered every system of railroad discipline in the
United States, and exposed the traveling public
to the mercy of service that is inefficient and demoralized.</p>

<p>For the rest, it will be evident that the foregoing
diagnosis of the situation bears on its face unmistakable
indications of the nature of the cure. At all
cost, interference with discipline must cease. This
conclusion admits no compromise. At the present
day every decision made by a superintendent is
practically subject to the approval of the Grievance
Committee. But this is not all: the railroad manager
is handicapped and held up at every turn. In
his dealings with the labor problem, if by any possibility
he manages to escape the fire, it can only be
by taking refuge in the frying-pan. An illustration
in point is the problem of keeping expenses within
reasonable limits and at the same time administering
discipline to the very men who, backed by powerful
organizations, are continually insisting upon
additions to the pay-rolls.</p>

<p>But now, granting the situation and the difficulties
as I have described them, in what direction are
we to look for relief? As it seems to me, an unmistakable
expression of public opinion would, in
the first place, go far in starting us all thinking
and working in the right direction. But even this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
will have little effect until railroad men wake up out
of the self-satisfied trance in which at present they
seem to be comfortably slumbering. Time was
when our forgetfulness of the public interests could
be accounted for by our own poverty and sufferings.
But these unhappy conditions no longer exist, for
to-day we are probably as well paid and otherwise
as well provided for and equipped as any class of
workers in the United States. Nevertheless, when
we are informed that in the year 1906 ten thousand
people were killed and one hundred thousand injured
on American railroads, the knowledge does
not seem to &#8220;give us pause&#8221; in any way, or to ruffle
our individual self-satisfaction; while our organizations
look at their surroundings silently and impassively
as the pyramids and obelisks look upon the
Egyptian deserts.</p>

<p>But affairs have now come to such a pass on the
roads that at last we are imperatively called upon
to answer questions and explain our position. Our
best friends are beginning to criticise us. They
remind us that interference with discipline is in
reality an attempt to take part in its administration,
and that our unions were never intended or organized
for that purpose. For a great many years an
educational campaign has been in progress all over
the country for the purpose of reminding us of our
duties and obligations to our unions. This educational<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
method has been extremely successful, and
has brought into being armies of laboring men
thoroughly loyal and self-centred. But the result
of this system on the railroads has been so disastrous
to human life that at last we are beginning
to realize that there is a limit even to the pursuit
of our individual well-being.</p>

<p>In paying attention, even at this late date, to the
higher call of the social conscience, we railroad men
shall enter a new world with brighter prospects
and a wider horizon. The nobility of labor has
always been the proud watchword of American
civilization. Let us be watchful lest we forfeit our
claim to share in this national distinction. By recognizing
our duties and responsibilities to society
in our treatment of these railroad problems, we
shall finally take our place in line with those who
through sacrifice and high endeavor are destined,
in good time, to cut out their way to industrial
freedom.</p>

LOYALTY</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> relations, co&ouml;perative and otherwise, that exist
between the men and the management of a railroad
are intimately connected with the safety and efficiency
of the service. Generally speaking, the
public is quite ignorant of the nature of these relations.
The men and the management may be working
harmoniously with a constant solicitude for the
safety and well-being of the patrons of the road;
or, on the other hand, they may be intrenched in
opposing camps, mutually watchful and suspicious
of each other, and more or less forgetful of the
wider and vastly more important interests of the
community at large. One way or the other, the public
knows little or nothing about the actual situation.
The managers of railroads are not in the habit
of discussing such matters or of taking the public
into their confidence; our organizations of railroad
men likewise pursue the even tenor of their way.
It seems to the writer that the time is opportune
for a candid discussion of this topic, with a view to
the education of public opinion, and in the general
interest of travelers by rail. A very brief preliminary
survey of the situation will not be out of place.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>It is, of course, unnecessary to dwell upon the
tremendous importance of the railroads as a factor
in our national life. Their ramifications are like
countless veins or arteries penetrating every nook
and corner of the continent. Backward and forward
through these arteries there passes and repasses an
endless procession of commerce and travel. In times
gone by these huge systems of national and international
intercourse have, for the most part, been
directed and kept in working order by boards of
management more or less personal and irresponsible
in their methods of administration. But within
a few years a great change has taken place. A new
partner, in the person of the railroad employee, has
literally pushed his way into the manager&#8217;s office.
So important a factor has he now become in the
councils of a railroad corporation that hardly a
move can be made in the operating department
without first consulting his rights and wishes. Not
only is the power and influence of the railroad employee
at the present day an important factor in
railroad management, but, in the opinion of competent
judges, the time is not far distant when
manager and employee will meet on equal terms
and together legislate for the interests of all concerned.
Now, granting the ever-increasing power
of the employee in framing the rules and influencing
the management, what is there to be said about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
division of responsibility? The question calls for
the most serious consideration of railroad men.
Manifestly, it also concerns the public interest;
for, in criticising conditions on our railroads, public
opinion should be thoroughly informed concerning
the situation, so that in all fairness it may call for
remedies and reform from the right quarter.</p>

<p>At the present day, when an accident happens
on a railroad and lives of passengers are sacrificed by
reason of the carelessness or neglect of employees,
practically the whole moral and financial responsibility
is immediately assumed by the management
Heartfelt regret is at once expressed by the highest
authorities, the injured are visited by sympathetic
officials, and every conceivable kind of bill or expense
is at once acknowledged and paid. On the
other hand we, the employees, singly and collectively,
ignore the whole business. We simply stand
back and let the press and the authorities figure out
reasons and remedies for themselves. We neither
adopt resolutions of sympathy nor pay out a single
dollar to benefit the families of the dead, or to alleviate
the sufferings of the injured.</p>

<p>Considering the division of power, does this adjustment
of responsibility appeal to any fair-minded
person? It has occurred to some of us that if we
or our organizations were assessed in hard cash in
proportion to our responsibility for some of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
preventable accidents, the casualty lists on our railroads
would very quickly assume microscopic proportions.
An &#8220;Employees&#8217; Liability Act&#8221; would,
of course, be looked upon as an absurdity; yet if
unprejudiced judges were to analyze a few of our
accidents, they would quickly conclude that the idea
is sanely and soberly logical. They would simply
consider the matter in the light of fair and square
taxation with unmistakable and ample representation.
It must not be forgotten that the manifestation
of power by railroad labor is to be looked for
not so much in the wording of schedules and agreements
as in what the managements of railroads
under pressure <i>feel constrained to refrain from
doing</i>. The fairness and cogency of this argument
may not &#8220;be as deep as a well&#8221; nor &#8220;as wide as a
church door,&#8221; but I think, in the words of Mercutio,
&#8220;&#8217;tis enough.&#8221; The questions and considerations
that arise in this way in regard to the interests of
the public, the management, and the men, are all
comprehensively included and can be profitably
discussed under the simple caption of loyalty,&mdash;on
the one hand, loyalty of the men to their employers,
and, on the other, loyalty of the employers to the
men.</p>

<p>No sincere well-wisher of the railroad employee
will question the importance of the relation that
exists, or that is supposed to exist, on American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
railroads, between labor and loyalty. Volumes have
been written about loyalty in the abstract. For the
most part politicians and teachers of national morality
and patriotism have monopolized these arguments.
The former would sink individualism in the
interest of the machine, the latter for the good of
their country. Granted the purity of their motives,
the efforts of these people are entirely praiseworthy;
and yet the significance and importance of loyalty
in the industrial life of the nation can by no means
be said to be included in the teachings of either
politician or patriot. On American railroads, in
particular, the question of the loyalty of employees
to the corporations and to the interests of the public
is vastly more important than a superficial glance
at the subject would lead one to suppose. Understanding
as we do the ever-increasing influence of
the employee, the problem which we have now to
consider relates to what at the present day he is
doing with his power, and to what, with his ever-increasing
importance, he intends to do with it in
the time to come. The future holds in it the answer
to these questions in terms of selfishness and abuse
of power, or in terms of loyalty to himself, the corporations,
and the public.</p>

<p>To attempt to give a definition of loyalty to apply
to and to cover this railroad business would simply
be time and effort thrown away. It is one thing to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
impress upon learned and critical readers that individualism
is in error and that loyalty is &#8220;willing
and practical devotion to a cause that is outside of
the individual and larger than he is.&#8221; It is quite
another affair, and altogether more important, to
reproduce our philosophy in terms of actual conduct
and behavior. Not one railroad man in a
thousand has either the time or the mental training
to study theories, and from the teachings of professors
to work out rules for his daily guidance; yet
it is manifest that the most useful and wholesome
ideas can be put to little practical utility in this
railroad business until the employee is aroused, and
some practical interpretation of them brought home
to him with unmistakable sincerity and emphasis.
While, therefore, it is unnecessary to supply railroad
men with a definition of loyalty, it will be just
as well to call attention to some of its most important
features.</p>

<p>Loyalty then, as applied to the railroad service,
means the safety of the traveling public so far as
human safeguards can be depended upon. Again,
comparing the service as it actually is with what it
might be, loyalty means the elimination of numerous
petty delays, and at times serious blockades,
which, at the present day, on many railroads, are
so annoying to the traveling public. This matter
of delays to passenger trains is quite an important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
feature, and it is surprising how much the personality
of the men and their interpretation of loyalty
to the public interest figure in the problem. Furthermore,
a stricter interpretation of loyalty by
employees on any given railroad can easily be
shown to mean a positive reduction in operating
expenses to the tune of thousands upon thousands
of dollars. These additional resources placed at
the disposal of the management would mean, of
course, funds wherewith to satisfy the never-ceasing
demands of employees for better conditions and
increase of pay. Finally, loyalty means fidelity; and
with fidelity comes sympathy; and with sympathy
comes practical and earnest co&ouml;peration between
management and men, without which safe and efficient
service is liable to be a mere delusion and will-o&#8217;-the-wisp.</p>

<p>Now, while it is a pleasure to bear witness to the
steadfast loyalty, frequently under trying conditions,
of numerous individual employees, it is nevertheless
the duty of the unprejudiced investigator to
call attention to the fact that the tendency of the
forces that are at work in this railroad business at
the present day, on the part both of the men and
of the management, is simply and positively to
eliminate loyalty as a useful and essential factor in
the administration of affairs. While the public, the
management, and the men are mixed up in the responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
for this unsatisfactory condition, the
blame for the lack of sympathetic co&ouml;peration,
which is only another term for loyalty, that exists
among us, must, to begin with, be laid at the door
of the employee himself. This is by no means the
hasty opinion of an individual thinker. Professor
Royce, an eminent authority on the subject, in a
lecture delivered at the Lowell Institute in Boston,
describes the situation very emphatically in the following
language:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The trades-unions demand and cultivate the
loyalty of their members; but they emphasize the
thesis that to be loyal to his union the laborer must
disregard certain duties to the community at large
and to the nation, duties which loyalty to loyalty
seems obviously to require.&#8221;</p>

<p>By loyalty to loyalty, Professor Royce means
&#8220;the maximum of loyalty to the world.&#8221; But professors
and students of industrial conditions are by
no means unsupported in their conclusions. That
labor leaders themselves are aware of the inherent
weakness of our position may be inferred from the
following extract from an editorial in &#8220;The International
Railroad Employee&#8221; for November, 1907.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may not lay claim to either the age or wisdom
to advise my brother workers what to do, but if you
will consider some of my suggestions relative to
your actions and surroundings, and talk them over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
among yourselves, I am sure you will be able to
find the world brighter for you. You seldom, if
ever, give any serious thought to bettering your
condition except by hoping for better wages. <i>Your
ideals begin and end with wages</i>, and so long as
that be true there is no possibility of your condition
being bettered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Surely this is a most uncomfortable and damaging
confession. Interpreted in terms of railroad service,
it should have the effect of causing the public to sit
up and think it all over. With all our education and
enlightenment, is it really a fact that the ideals
and humanity of the American railroad man can be
crammed into a nutshell in this way by honest and
practical investigators, and labeled &#8220;wages&#8221;? At
the present day the assertion that corporations are
soulless has almost the nature and force of an
axiom. It would now appear, according to the authorities
just quoted, that the policy and ideals of
labor, as represented by the American railroad
man, are not only soulless but brainless as well.</p>

<p>So far in this discussion we have been dealing
with theories and opinions. It now remains to be
seen, by actual example and illustration, upon what
ground or basis these theories have been advanced.
In plain English, what is the actual and manifest
cost, in character and dollars, of this lack of loyalty
to the world at large which is a distinguishing feature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
of railroad life at the present day? It is hardly
fair to call it a lack of individual loyalty, for at
heart the American railroad man is thoroughly
loyal; but, unfortunately, the systems of labor organization
and management under whose direction
he works, practically call upon him to renounce his
personal principles in the interest of schedules and
agreements which constitute the machinery of the
operating department.</p>

<p>It may, of course, be taken for granted that managers
of railroads are well aware of the importance
and value of practical loyalty in all branches of the
service; and yet when one examines the evidence
with a view to ascertaining what they actually do
for its encouragement, one is driven to conclude
that there must be some kind of a hitch somewhere.
As an illustration let us take the following incident,
which is almost an everyday occurrence:&mdash;</p>

<p>Freight train No. 1 pulls into a yard a few miles
outside the terminal. The train and engine crew
are on overtime; that is to say, every hour they remain
out on the road means a great many dollars
in wages over and above their regular pay. Before
long, another freight train, No. 2, overtakes train
No. 1. Instead of pulling into the yard and doing
its work in turn, this second train runs up the main
line and backs in ahead of train No. 1, thus putting
it in a pocket. In this way train No. 1 is delayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
three or four hours, thus causing the engine to be
late for the return service; and altogether an extra
and entirely unnecessary expense of perhaps fifty
dollars is entailed upon the railroad.</p>

<p>A few days later, the writer, happening to meet
the engineman of train No. 2, spoke to him in regard
to the affair. He appeared to be very much
surprised that his conduct should be questioned or
criticised in any way. He had supposed it was every
man&#8217;s duty to shift for himself; to <i>jump</i> another
train whenever an opportunity presented itself,
and to get to his destination as quickly as possible.
The question of the interest of the company was a
side issue, to which he paid little attention. If
loyalty of this kind was a matter of importance to
the company, why, he contended, was the attention
of the men not called to such matters in some
emphatic way? So far as he was aware, the management
had little to say on any subject except as
its views were set forth in the rules and regulations.
In his opinion it was every man for himself on the
one hand, and every official for himself on the
other; and whenever their interests or opinions
clashed, it became the duty of the management and
the grievance committee to settle the differences.
This engineman was not far wrong so far as concerned
the actual conditions of his daily work; and
yet the management of a railroad takes a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
more interest in such matters than this man had
any idea of.</p>

<p>Some time ago a vice-president of one of our
railroad systems addressed a gathering of some five
hundred railroad station-agents and clerks. He had
a good deal to say to the men about loyalty. He
tried to impress upon his hearers that railroad men
should think less about their wages and their
material prosperity and more about character and
the duties they owed to their employers and to the
public. The prosperity of the men was in every way
dependent upon the prosperity of the road; consequently,
every act of loyalty, every little economy,
was a genuine factor in obtaining satisfactory results
and returns for the road. In the matter of supplies,
for example, employees could do splendid work for
the road if they would only put their minds to it.
But it was not such an easy matter nowadays to put
a stop to waste in some departments, even when its
practice was shameful and persistent. Of course, it
was an easy matter to find fault with a station-agent
if he used a pint of ink over and above his allowance;
but when the operating department consumed
thousands of gallons of oil per year more than was
absolutely necessary, the problem became much
more complicated. However, seeing that reporters
were excluded from the hall, he would venture to
say that in the single case of oil it was possible for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
engine crews, by the exercise of the simplest loyalty
and regard for the prosperity of the road, to reduce
the expenditure in that one item to the extent of
many thousands of dollars per year. But, of course,
in the interest of harmony it would never do to tell
enginemen and firemen that they are deliberately
wasteful or lacking in loyalty to their employers.</p>

<p>To say the least, one gets the impression from
these remarks that railroad officials are called upon
to pursue their labors with something in the nature
of a &#8220;sword of Damocles&#8221; suspended over their
heads. However, it must not be supposed that instances
of loyalty on a railroad are few and far
between. On the contrary, from time to time the
attention of the management is directed to instances
of conspicuous and profitable loyalty.</p>

<p>Some time ago one of the largest freight yards
in the western part of the state enjoyed a very unenviable
reputation for breakages of draw-bars,
derailments of cars, and all sorts of unnecessary
delays to passenger trains. Finally a change was
made in the yard-master. The new man began
operations with heart-to-heart conversations with
the yardmen. If they had grievances he was ready
to straighten them out. The men had his sympathy
and backing, and in return he requested their co&ouml;peration
in order to convert the record of the yard
from the worst to the best on the system.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>Working in this sympathetic yet practical way,
in a year&#8217;s time he had succeeded even beyond his
expectation. While handling a much larger volume
of business, the operating expenses and the bills for
breakages were reduced many thousands of dollars.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_095.jpg" width="40%" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A TYPICAL DERAILMENT</p>

<p>Illustrations of a similar nature can be multiplied
indefinitely, but one will serve as well as a hundred
to demonstrate the fact that railroad men as a rule
give little thought to the matter, and that railroad
managers, while quite aware of its significance and
value, seldom go out of the beaten routine of their
regular duties to impress upon their employees the
importance of the issues at stake. The following
somewhat remarkable illustration will throw additional
light on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>On one of the busiest sections of a New England
railroad a certain foreman has charge of a gang of
men. This foreman is a good average man, something
of a &#8220;hustler,&#8221; and thoroughly capable and
experienced. When carefully examined, however,
his record revealed the fact that he had been unable
to keep a man on his gang more than a month or
two at a time. During ten or twelve years&#8217; service
he had to break in and teach the business, practically
in vain, to upwards of two hundred green men.
Now there is a right and a wrong way of driving
spikes and tamping ties, and poor and inexperienced
work means broken rails, jumping of track<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
by cars, and a variety of accidents. The foreman in
question is a thoroughly conscientious man. In
driving his men in unreasonable fashion he fancies
he is working in the interests of the railroad company.
He considers himself loyal to the backbone,
and yet he is probably the most expensive section
foreman on the division.</p>



<p>At another point on the same railroad a different
kind of a section foreman is stationed. This man has
been on one and the same section for fifteen years,
and of his original gang of seven men he still retains
five. Of the two who are missing, one is dead,
the other accumulated a little competency and retired
from the service. This foreman is, comparatively
speaking, a very quiet man. He is methodical
and exact in everything he does. He always addresses
his men in a low tone, but with considerable
emphasis. His men like him, and they work behind
his back in exactly the same manner as when he is
standing over them. His conduct is not so much a
matter of temperament as of downright calculation
and of thought upon the real value and meaning of
loyalty to the interests of his employers.</p>

<p>Drawing up the facts in the cases of these two
foremen, the writer sent them to an experienced
road-master, with the request that he would kindly
give him an idea as to what, in his opinion, would
be the difference in actual cash value of the services<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
to the railroad of these two foremen. He replied
that he was much interested in the question,
and had looked up the records of the sections with
considerable minuteness, and was of the opinion
that the conduct and loyalty of the foreman in the
second illustration represented a saving to the company
of at least a thousand dollars a year. But in
answer to a further inquiry as to what notice or encouragement
the loyalty of the men received in his
department, he replied that no particular attention
was paid to it by the management, that such matters
were allowed to drift, for the simple reason
that the men were organized and that the agreements
between the company and the unions call for
promotion in turn, or what practically amounts to
the same thing, and that, in short, there was certainly
no organized method or means by which loyalty
could be recognized or rewarded.</p>

<p>For the purpose of demonstrating the value of a
thoughtful consideration of the interests of a railroad
corporation, no illustration can be considered
too insignificant. At a certain junction point a man
has charge of fifty lamps. At another station another
man secures equally good results from the same
number of lamps while burning a fraction of a
cent&#8217;s worth less oil per lamp per night. By actual
investigation and test, it was discovered that the
second man handled the business with a saving to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
the company of practically one dollar per year per
lamp. This was very interesting when one considers
the thousands of switch and other lamps that
burn nightly all the year round on a railroad system.
Carrying the inquiry a little farther, the writer
was able to ascertain that, so far as known, only
two or three railroads in the United States take
any notice of such information when they happen
to possess it; they do not commend the employees
for faithful service, and thus stimulate others to like
meritorious efforts.</p>

<p>The Santa F&eacute; Railroad is a notable exception to
the general rule. In December, 1907, this road published
a list of employees who had been heartily
thanked by the management and given merit marks
for loyalty to the road and the public, not only in
cases of emergency, but in the simplest cases of
thoughtfulness and economical workmanship. The
following is taken from a list of forty:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;E. H. Vaden, Engineer, and W. L. Sims, Fireman,
ten merit marks each for discovering switch
in bad condition and without a light, making it safe
and afterwards providing a light.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the risk of making a slight digression from
the main line of my argument, I am tempted to add
a few lines regarding methods of management on
the Santa F&eacute;. They are taken from a report of one
of the officials, and probably represent the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
up-to-date and sanest railroad management in the
country to-day:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;To make an effort to reduce injuries and accidents
to the lowest possible minimum, the company
has felt justified in creating an office to handle in
a systematic manner the question of preventing
accidents and injuries. Great and astonishing results
can be obtained along these lines by constant
attention and earnest work on the part of the person
in charge of this office, and by securing the
co&ouml;peration of all employees and the assistance of
the heads of the different departments. It is, therefore,
very necessary that the &#8216;<i>safety officer</i>&#8217; be as
thoroughly acquainted as possible with all the men
over the entire system, and personally call their
attention to the importance of lending their assistance
to this cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>In contrast to the personal attention that is paid
to the human element on the Santa F&eacute;, let us
glance at the methods pursued on railroads in the
East. You will find in our railroad offices an exact
record and working history of every piece of equipment,
from a spike to a locomotive. Every draw-bar,
every coupler, every passenger coach, and practically
every engine-tire has to give an account of
itself. The performances of these &#8220;parts&#8221; are carefully
scrutinized and watched. You will be shown
all sorts of diagrams, charts, and volumes of statistics<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
going to show the care and expense devoted to
equipment and machinery. But if you happen to
ask for a few human statistics you are likely to be
disappointed. For instance, if a certain train crew
runs a freight train two hundred times in a year,
breaking seventy draw-bars and upon different occasions
delaying thirty-seven passenger trains, and
another crew under very similar conditions pulls
out only thirteen draw-bars and delays only nine
passenger trains, you may consider the records quite
important; but in the railroad offices you will find
no statistics of this nature, no comparative statements
and diagrams illustrative of the workmanship
and character of different men and of the value
and significance of the human element in the running
of a railroad. In a word, you will infer from
your investigation that if it isn&#8217;t a machine or a
piece of machinery it isn&#8217;t worth bothering about.</p>

<p>Finally, let us take a very significant illustration,
in which the traveling public should be somewhat
interested. The other day a through passenger train
arrived at a junction in the western part of Massachusetts.
It was on its way east, and was practically
on time. But at this point it became necessary for
the engineman to renew the water-supply. Consequently
he cut off his engine and ran down some
little distance to the water-stand. After an interval
of twenty minutes, as the engine had not returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
to the train, the station-master went down to investigate
the delay. He found the engineman and fireman
sitting quietly in the cab waiting for a brakeman
to come and turn on the water. It was some brakeman&#8217;s
duty to do this work at this point, and as he
failed to appear, business came to a standstill. The
engineman knew his rights and stuck to them.
The idea of loyalty to the interests of the corporation
and the public could not be permitted to enter
into the question, for the reason that to do another
man&#8217;s work, even in a case of emergency, would be
to surrender rights and privileges which had been
fought for and secured after months of agitation
and diplomacy. The train was thirty minutes late
at its destination. In such cases the management
is helpless.</p>

<p>It matters little that my illustrations may be criticised
as uncommon occurrences. The principle that
tolerates the situation is surely out of place on a
railroad. By way of contrast, the following item
taken from the merit list on the Santa F&eacute; Railroad
is both interesting and significant:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;J. E. Helms, Engineer, and M. C. Collins, Fireman,
ten merit marks for coaling up engine 1029
when the coal chute was out of service.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strange as the statement may seem at first sight,
we railroad people at the present day are suffering
from a very peculiar form of mental blindness. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
the point will be more comprehensible if we
call it &#8220;department paralysis.&#8221; Our vision seems
to be strictly limited to our own departments or
spheres of action. In this way every department on
a railroad is loyal to itself and more or less forgetful
of the other departments. For example, the
operating department is responsible for the care
and prompt movement of trains. In a general way
it is taken for granted that these movements must
be made with safety as well as dispatch. And yet,
looking into the matter closely, we are able to discover
that dispatch and not safety is the main feature
and business. Unfortunately there is no safety
department on a railroad, or rather safety takes
pot-luck in all the departments. Altogether, safety
finds it no easy matter to secure recognition, and
city governments, railroad commissioners, and railroad
officials all seem to suffer from department
paralysis upon occasions when loyalty to the interests
of the traveling public would seem to demand
a much clearer and wider vision. To all appearances
it is impossible for these departments to see beyond
the precincts of their own particular hobby or vocation.
Let us take a very pertinent illustration:&mdash;</p>

<p>The other day, in the vicinity of Boston, several
teams were smashed and two persons were killed
at a well-known and very dangerous crossing. It
being Christmas time, there had been an almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
continuous procession of vehicles all day long over
the crossing. At a moment when perhaps the crush
was greatest, the gong in the gate-house gave warning
that an express train was approaching. Immediately
there ensued a wild scramble to hustle the
stream of humanity over the crossing and out of
the way of the train. It was no easy task for the
gateman. Regardless of the descending gates, a
number of teams, unable to turn aside, made a final
dash to get to the other side. To drop the gates on
the backs of the horses was out of the question,
and, as a last resort, frantic yet useless attempts
were made to flag the approaching train. In the
midst of the excitement the flyer dashed upon the
scene with disastrous results.</p>

<p>The following day the accident was thoroughly
and fearlessly discussed in the newspapers. There
was no difference of opinion on the subject. Practically
speaking, every one representing the state,
the city, the railroad, and the newspapers, agreed
to concentrate their minds on the grade-crossing
problem. It should be abolished. This is the universal
&#8220;hobby&#8221; and a good one, no doubt, but
apparently no one can see an inch farther. The
questions <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> people are killed almost
every day at these crossings received no attention
whatever. Public opinion, not unreasonably perhaps,
is satisfied with the assurance that everything humanly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
and reasonably possible under the circumstances
was done by the railroad men concerned in
it to <i>get the teams out of the way of the trains</i>. But
it did not occur to any one that the whole system
of keeping teams out of the way of trains is inherently
and inexcusably wrong. The list of victims
who are sacrificed to this popular mistake is being
added to daily. If the public has any right at all on
these crossings, it goes without question that, while
they are making use of their rights and in the act
of crossing, their safety should depend, not upon
their efforts to scramble out of the way of the trains,
but upon the moral and legal obligation of the railroads
<i>to keep the trains out of the way of the vehicles</i>.</p>

<p>This view, of course, is based on the supposition
that the safety of the public is of more importance
than the speed of the trains over these crossings.
In the case we are now considering, if an empty
coal car had been on the crossing it would have
been amply protected from the passenger train.
Not only is this true, but the tracks of another railroad
cross this highway diagonally at this point,
and while trains are crossing they are doubly protected
by semaphore targets and derailing switches.
Teams, however, and passengers on foot have to
depend on emergency arrangements which, as we
all know, are practically useless. If railroads can
afford to protect their rolling-stock in the way described,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
the interests and property of the public
might reasonably be expected to receive equal consideration.
In plain language, the pressing of a button
in crossing-houses, in connection with proper
signals, would give the public the protection so
urgently called for. Altogether the foregoing may
be taken as a very good object lesson on the safety
problem on our railroads.</p>

<p>This crossing accident took place in December,
1907. Within a mile of the scene, on the next crossing,
in the month of July, 1908, another accident
occurred under similar conditions. In this case a
wagon was demolished, two horses were killed, and
a number of passengers on an express train were
injured. Comment is unnecessary.</p>

<p>For the rest, the interest and significance of this
essay will be sadly misunderstood if the impression
is in any way derived from it that the railroad
employee is singled out and must stand alone as
an object of adverse criticism. As a matter of fact,
a volume can be written in our defense. Only too
many of us can remember the time when a deserving
employee could be, and frequently was, discharged
on the flimsiest pretext. His breakfast
disagreed with a yard-master or he happened to
have domestic troubles on his mind: for less reason
than this good men were sent packing. Not ten
years ago the service on New England railroads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
swarmed with favorites and brothers-in-law. Faithful
old employees were sent adrift without a moment&#8217;s
warning or sympathy, to make room for
youngsters with a &#8220;pull.&#8221; Many an honest old servitor,
not so very long ago either, with justice and
reason might have flung the retort of old Adam, in
&#8220;As You Like It,&#8221; at his superior. &#8220;Is &#8216;old dog&#8217;
my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in
your service.&#8221; But we have changed all that. Nevertheless,
these things rankle. They say history
repeats itself. Justice certainly does; and as for
injustice it reacts and rebounds, and perhaps, after
many days, it returns and demands a settlement at
compound interest. The situation to-day between
labor and capital is but a chapter in the natural
history of the instinct of self-defense.</p>

<p>Finally, in regard to the lack of loyalty to the
world at large, the railroad employee is far from
being the only offender. While it may be said to
be strictly unintentional, this lack of loyalty covers
our railroads as with a blanket. The illustrations
given above have been chosen with strict impartiality,
and regardless of the personality of the offenders.
With the panorama of railroad life before
us, as I have endeavored to sketch it, we railroad
men should be able to contemplate the conditions,
and our conduct in relation to them, as in a looking-glass.
While the writer&#8217;s sincere desire from beginning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
to end has been to avoid giving unnecessary
offense to any one, yet it should not be forgotten
that to take away life, either needlessly or heedlessly,
on a railroad is an offense against society
that calls for the utmost rigor of treatment.</p>

THE SQUARE DEAL</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the days of the Roman Republic, when a consul
was invested with supreme power, he received a
caution or command somewhat as follows: &#8220;See to
it that the Republic receives no injury.&#8221;</p>

<p>This injunction is quite as significant and important
to-day, both to individuals and to public officials,
as it was a thousand years ago. Then, as now,
the interests of the community were the first and
paramount consideration. But in discussing questions
relating to these interests, such as, for instance,
those which have arisen between labor and
management on our railroads, public opinion, as
represented by the press and the laws, should insist
upon a fair field, no favor, and absolutely open
play on all sides.</p>

<p>We need only glance at the safety problem on
American railroads to appreciate it thoroughly.
During 1907, on a single well-known railroad, thirty
passengers were killed and 1596 injured; 572 trespassers
killed and 526 injured; 72 people were
killed at grade crossings and 518 injured; twelve
contractor&#8217;s men were killed and ten injured; the
total killed numbered 686, and the injured 2650.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
These figures are not inclusive of employees. The
biggest single item of the year&#8217;s disaster for personal
injuries fell under the head of collisions, 76
of them resulting in 456 claims, to the account of
which the charge was $145,748. The total was 876
claims for personal injuries, costing $746,075, still
leaving 2345 unsettled cases at the expiration of
the year.</p>

<p>Some time ago, in the Chicago &#8220;Record-Herald,&#8221;
E. P. Ripley, president of the Santa F&eacute; system,
was quoted as follows: &#8220;One of the most serious
conditions which this country is facing to-day is
the indifference and disregard which the employee
has for the interests of the employer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Santa F&eacute;,&#8221; continued Mr. Ripley, &#8220;hopes
to establish a better <i>esprit de corps</i> among its employees,
and expects that a liberal pension system
will have that tendency. We have on this system
as much loyalty as most railroads enjoy, if not more,
but it is not what it should be. The lack of loyalty
among employees is a condition from which all corporations
are now suffering, and it presents a most
serious problem.&#8221;</p>

<p>It matters little to what railroad one turns for
information on this subject, Mr. Ripley&#8217;s remarks,
in a greater or less degree, apply to them all. Quite
recently, in discussing this topic, the manager of
another railroad uttered the same opinion from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
somewhat different standpoint. He remarked in substance,
&#8220;During the last week, at three different sessions,
a committee of employees came to this office for
the purpose of arbitrating, or coming to some understanding
about, a matter of discipline. These men
fought tooth and nail for what they considered their
rights in this case, and finally, at the third hearing,
an agreement was arrived at, which, if you choose,
you may call a compromise. So far so good. But now
to-day, these same men, or rather two of them, representing
different organizations, have been up here
again. Some kind of a dispute has arisen between
these organizations, and they called upon me, with
assurances of belief in my ability and impartiality,
to act as final arbitrator between them. This means,
of course, that I must devote two or three hours of
my time to their private interests. Be this as it may,
I consented to act as arbitrator, but at the same
time I couldn&#8217;t help wondering how these men
could find it in their hearts to accept my verdict in
their private affairs, about which I know comparatively
little, while they persistently question my
judgment, and practically my honesty of purpose,
in matters of discipline and management. In a
word,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;why don&#8217;t the employees
trust the management to administer the affairs of
the railroad conscientiously and fairly, and to give
to each employee a square deal?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>During the palmy days of what may be called
autocratic management, when a railroad man started
out in the morning, the paymaster, or the office-boy,
for that matter, could have told you the exact amount
the man would have been entitled to on his return.
The employee was willing, and in fact had agreed,
to travel or to work from a point A to a point B
for a certain fixed sum. So far as his pay was concerned,
it made no difference whether he covered
the distance in eight hours or eighteen. If a yard-master
delayed him for two or three hours before
starting, and if he lost half a day on the road by
reason of wrecks, disablement of locomotive, or a
washout, so much the worse for him. His duty was
to go from A to B and to do what he was told to on
the way, without question, even if it took him from
sunrise to sunrise to cover the distance. There was
no help or rescue in sight, no appeal from the discipline
in those days; and if the work was not to
his liking, the world was wide, and a dozen men
were ready to step into his place.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the one-sidedness and injustice of
the whole proceeding were manifest to everybody,
and from year to year it remained to be talked about,
objected to, and brooded over. But with ever-increasing
business and complication of conditions,
a much better educated class of men found their
way into the railroad service. In moving a train from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
place to place, greater intelligence was required. A
conductor to-day can frequently run from one end
of the road to the other in a purely mechanical
fashion; but in the early days of railroading, with
a single track, a confusion of flags and train orders,
and a multitude of unforeseen difficulties awaiting
him at every station, it took little less than genius
to make a successful railroad man.</p>

<p>The really heart-breaking story of the hardship
and heroism of the trainmen of those days has never
been written, but a touch of the stern reality and
pathos of it all can be imagined from the single
consideration, that of seventeen freight conductors
who in the year 1883 ran trains through the Hoosac
Tunnel, only five in the year 1888, that is, five years
later, were still to be found on the pay-rolls. In
nearly every instance, death in violent form had
removed the others. Of course, as we all know, the
most popular type of heroism is to be looked for
on the battlefield; but there are hundreds of railroad
veterans on the streets to-day, undecorated and
unremembered, whose services to the country are all
worthy of popular sympathy and national gratitude.</p>

<p>As a result of these extraordinary conditions and
the continual killing of employees, a new and more
intelligent class of men was called upon, in course of
time, to undertake the dangerous duties of railroad
service. With increased intelligence and broader<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
mental equipment, the thinking process in the brain
of the railroad man expanded, and very naturally
his awakened attention was not exclusively centred
on the business of his employers. It soon became
known to officials, and to the world, that we had
grievances. Before long, rumblings of discontent
were heard on all sides. Between ourselves we began
to discuss matters of right and wrong. The
men got together in groups, in small gatherings.
Here and there, all over the country, little Runnymedes
were attended by all conscientious, determined
railroad men. With an ever-increasing
demand for our services, came consciousness of
importance and power. Attention was called to the
injustice, the inconsistency of the situation. We
petitioned and agitated for trifles. Inch by inch
ground was gained. Frequently we were beaten
back, sometimes routed, at other times the battle
was drawn; but after every encounter, regardless
of result, the ghost of the future remained on the
field to disturb the slumbers of the management.
So, through the years, the struggle proceeded, concession
followed concession, until all kinds of injustice
and favoritism, and in fact the whole system
of purely autocratic management, had gone by the
board, and fair play for the railroad trainman was
an accomplished fact. For the future, to ask was to
receive. Face to face with organizations of determined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
men, with the crops and manufactures of
half a continent waiting to be moved to the seaboard,
what was a management or a combination
of managements going to do about it?</p>

<p>Thus, by evolution and revolution, a mighty
change has come over the scene. To-day, when a
railroad man makes a trip from point A to point
B, it is altogether different from the performance
to which I called attention at the beginning of this
essay. At the end of his trip, the man now takes
out his pencil and does some figuring. Neither the
superintendent nor the paymaster has the slightest
idea what the engineman&#8217;s, the conductor&#8217;s, or the
brakeman&#8217;s bill for a day&#8217;s work is going to be. If
a man is delayed on a road by the negligence of a
fellow employee, the company will have to pay for
the extra time. If he makes a straight trip, with one
or two stops, he has a certain rate; if in the performance
of his duties he is called upon to make an
extra stop or to pick up a car of perishable goods,
he will call for a special rate and much more money.
His day&#8217;s trip frequently bristles with possibilities
in the way of special rates and overtime. In the
matter of overtime, he may have the opportunity
to be just or unjust, as it pleases him; anyway, the
company is at his mercy. Again, if at the end of a
hundred-mile run, or thereabouts, for which an engineman
would receive from four to five dollars,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
he is requested to take his engine out on the road
again and move a car a distance of twenty feet, he
will turn in his bill to the company for a greater
amount than a gate-tender or a switchman would
receive for his whole day&#8217;s work, from six in the
morning until six at night, without a minute for
meals.</p>

<p>Again, if a man gets into trouble, he is called
into the office for an investigation. If it turns out
that the accident was unquestionably the fault of
the employee, he, of course, is liable to be disciplined
for it in some way; but if as a result of the
accident, the whole road is tied up for twelve hours,
and he remains on duty half a day longer than his
usual time, he will receive payment for this overtime
in full, regardless of the fact that he himself
was wholly responsible for the delay.</p>

<p>Far from criticising this state of affairs, I consider
the demonstration I have given of the exact
status of the railroad man at the present day a magnificent
tribute to righteous and necessary organization.
Up to this point the public has had no cause
to complain, and discipline has not been interfered
with. The treasury has borne the whole burden.
While it is doubtless true that the liberal terms
and concessions to which I refer have been brought
about, so to speak, at the point of the bayonet,
nevertheless many privileges and advantages are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
enjoyed by railroad men, which cannot be said to
owe their origin to compulsion or pressure of any
kind. The care shown by nearly all railroads for the
welfare of the employee, and the millions of dollars
that have been expended for his social and intellectual
betterment, must also be taken as direct
evidence of square and honest treatment. To combat
the evils of the saloon, and in the interest of
good citizenship, both on and off the railroad, the
corporations have gone extensively and expensively
into the construction and maintenance of reading-rooms
and hospitals, as well as relief, savings, and
loan associations. There is, indeed, a fine sense of
business judgment hidden away in these different
methods of looking after the interests of the employees,
and there is hardly a road in the country
that does not recognize the principle that to obtain
competent, trained assistants, especially in the
operating department, it is essential that the men
be surrounded with all sorts of inducements to remain
in the service, and to be loyal to the interests
of their employers. This philanthropic and betterment
work is to be found on all railroads, and conspicuously
so on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio. The
following particulars of relief and betterment work
on the above railroad may be taken as a lesson of
what corporations with souls are doing in the interests
of employees.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>Membership in the Relief Department of the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio is compulsory on the part of all
employed in the direct operation of the road. The
employees themselves have part in the direction of
the affairs of the organization. The company makes
all collections and payments, under its guarantee
of responsibility for every penny coming into or
going out through its hands. The company also
pledges itself to pay four per cent interest on the
monthly balances of current accounts; no charge is
made for office rent, and all the facilities of the
road are at command, without cost. Operating expenditure
is thus reduced to a minimum, and upon
transactions during the year 1906-1907, which represented
a million dollars distributed in benefits,
the expense averaged but a dollar and sixty-eight
cents per capita of membership. The aggregate of
the benefits paid from the founding of the Relief
to the close of the year 1906-1907, was thirteen
millions of dollars.</p>

<p>The Baltimore &amp; Ohio plan for pension payments,
in vogue for the past twenty-three years, is in conjunction
with the Relief Department, but is not, as
that is, maintained by the contributions of employees.
The pension system is maintained entirely
by the company, which contributes for the purpose
about $90,000 annually. During the year 1906-1907
the fund paid in pensions was over $95,000, to about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
400 pensioners. Since its inauguration in 1884,
there has been paid out in pensions, $1,008,000.</p>

<p>Again, the foundation of two other features&mdash;Savings
and Loan&mdash;in the Baltimore &amp; Ohio dates
back a full quarter of a century. The Savings is
strictly a trust fund, around it being thrown the
unequivocal protection of the United States government
in the decision handed down by its courts.
Of course this is understood by employee-depositors;
consequently there is absolute confidence.
There are no runs, no anxiety as to savings, and
no fear that what has been laid aside for a rainy
day will be risked. Meantime, upon it the company
is guaranteeing four per cent and earnings; the interest
and dividend returns thus amount to never
less than five and sometimes five and a half per
cent. The total of the savings deposits to June 30,
1907, reached eight and a half million dollars, and
interest and dividends paid to employee-depositors
to that time came to a million and a half dollars.</p>

<p>The Baltimore &amp; Ohio loan feature is still more
remarkable. The object is to enable the employees
to own their own homes. All are real-estate transactions,
and it is a remarkable fact that the administration
of this feature, throughout twenty-five
years, has been entirely without appreciable loss
on any single investment. Employee-borrowers have
entered into personal obligations representing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
building of two thousand houses and the purchase
of three thousand homesteads. The transactions of
the loan section to June 30 represented six and
three-quarter millions of dollars, when there was
also a million and a quarter in the treasury, upon
which the company&#8217;s guarantee of four per cent
held good.</p>

<p>Rest-houses are another form through which welfare
work in the direct interest of the employee is
carried on as part of the regular operation of the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad. The aim is to furnish
a comfortable and convenient place, open at all
hours, to the employee coming in from his run,
whose first want is a bath, with plenty of hot water,
and subsequently a restful bed. The work carried
on by the Railroad Y. M. C. A. is of a similar nature.
The old-time dark cabooses, dingy freight
cars, and decrepit coaches, serving as night-holes
into which to crawl for the sleeping hours till the
time for the next run, are now nothing but an unpleasant
memory. The Railroad Y. M. C. A., with
its commodious lounging-rooms, bright and airy
dining-rooms, clean lunch-counters, well-appointed
kitchens, billiard rooms and bowling alleys, general
assembly halls, libraries, attractive bedrooms and
baths, is the practical exemplification to-day of the
fitness of things. The disbursements of the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio Railroad for these purposes have in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
single years exceeded fifty thousand dollars, and
every penny is profitably expended from the purely
business standpoint. Bettering the man betters his
work.</p>

<p>Furthermore, incident to the administration of
the Relief Department, the company, through a
corps of medical examiners and surgeons, closely
supervises the health of its employees and the sanitary
conditions of the places where their duties are
performed. This corps is in charge of a chief surgeon
and chief medical examiner, both prominent
in their professions; and although the number of
men in their charge exceeds forty thousand, any
complicated or persistent disability of an employee
secures the personal supervision of the chief surgeon.</p>

<p>This is surely a remarkable demonstration of
what one corporation is doing, and has done, for the
benefit of its employees. It is very doubtful if any
government or any other industrial institution in the
world can show any such record, and one which
extends over such a long term of years. Fair and
humane treatment of employees cannot be carried
any further.</p>

<p>Having in this way, for the present, made an end
of the evidence as regards the men, let us now turn
to the management. It will, I think, be admitted
that the running and operation of trains on American
railroads calls for some system of management<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
and discipline that shall be absolutely untrammeled
and free from outside influence or interference. In
a word, the manager of the operating department
of a railroad should be permitted to manage. Public
opinion, of course, is always free to express itself
as it thinks fit on this and on kindred subjects, but
it will be found to be utterly unjust in its position
if it allows itself in any way to connive at the undermining
of authority, and at the same time holds this
authority responsible for results. Yet it does not
call for a national mind-reader to extract from the
history of public sentiment the uncomfortable conclusion
that the laws and the press of the country,
to a great extent, still harbor their ancient grudge,
and are not prepared to treat railroad managers impartially.
So accustomed have managers become to
adverse criticism that they are now almost tongue-tied
on the subject of their duties, and simple
sufferance has become the badge of the fraternity.
The manager may now be likened to a horse,
willing and able to trot his distance with credit to
himself and his owners; but behind him, on the box-seat,
sits public opinion, the labor organization at
his side. The horse is willing enough, and eager to
work and to do his duty, but every effort to exert
himself or to get into his stride is rewarded with a
violent jerk of the rein. The effect of this treatment
on any kind of an animal can be imagined. That the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
traveling public should be at the mercy of a three-cornered
management of this nature, is rather remarkable.
If managers nowadays were inclined to
be autocratic or overbearing in matters relating to
the public safety, there might be some excuse for
the situation. On the contrary, to most people it
will appear that they have already parted with the
best part of their birthright. The following is the
agreement on the subject, in force on nearly all
railroads:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Employees shall not be disciplined or dismissed
without cause. In case discipline is thought to be
unjust, the employee may refer his case, in writing,
to the superintendent, after which he shall be given
a hearing within seven days. The aggrieved party
may be present at all investigations and may be
represented by a fellow employee of the same class.
In the event of this investigation proving unsatisfactory,
the case may be appealed to higher officials
in regular order. If the accused is found blameless,
his record will remain as previous thereto, and he
shall receive pay for all time lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such an agreement will, I think, appear to most
people to be remarkably fair and generous. Unfortunately
for the interest of the public, it approaches
the danger point. It is very doubtful if many, or
any, private industrial establishments could be persuaded
to sign any such agreement with their employees.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
Manifestly it makes a cipher of the superintendent.
But taking our agreement just as it is,
the manager should at least be allowed to manage,
and appeal should be limited to the officials of
the road. <i>The line must be drawn just where responsibility
is wanted and needed.</i> That the management
of a railroad should invite interference or assistance
from grievance committees or national organizations
of labor men, in matters of discipline, is absurd. The
situation has been forced upon them. It has been
forced upon them during &#8220;rush hours,&#8221; when business
was at high tide and pressure, and when the
public was clamoring for its fast trains and for the
prompt delivery of freight. Such are the stormy
times on railroads, when discipline is lax and when
concessions are granted at the expense of the public
safety. Blame the management if you will,&mdash;the
results and consequences are before us for consideration
and remedy. Most of us understand something
about rebates on a shipment of oil or cotton goods,
and about the penalties that are enforced against
offenders; but we do not seem to realize the fact
that to-day on our railroads there are, in actual operation,
rebates on the efficiency of the service, which
are being paid for by the people, not in dollars and
cents, but in blood and suffering.</p>

<p>But putting on one side public opinion and its
influence on the efficiency of railroad service, what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
is the nature of the treatment that the employee
himself, with his eyes wide open and his wits about
him, is willing to give to the management and to
the public, when he has the power and the opportunity
to work in a little legislation for himself? For
illustration, let us take what is commonly called the
&#8220;Bumping Process.&#8221; Of course no management in
its right mind would ever originate or put into service
any such suicidal arrangement. From beginning
to end it is a ludicrous, at times a pathetic, commentary
on the seniority rule. It works somewhat in
this way:&mdash;</p>

<p>On account of slack business, a crew consisting
of a conductor and two or three men is relieved from
duty. The conductor immediately looks over his
list and picks out another job to his liking, the
holder of which happens to be his junior in the service.
The man who is thus turned out does the
same to some one else, and meanwhile the discharged
brakemen have been &#8220;bumping&#8221; other brakemen.
So it goes on from one end of the division to the
other, until some twenty or thirty men have been
&#8220;bumped&#8221; out of their accustomed and hard-earned
places. Finally, three or four of the youngest employees
are bumped into space, at the end of the
string, and the &#8220;bumping&#8221; ceases for lack of material.
The management has had absolutely nothing
to do with the affair; it can protect neither its own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
interests nor those of the public. The whole business
must be looked upon as the natural sequel of
the seniority principle. It is a concession granted
during &#8220;rush hours,&#8221; when bumping was not anticipated.
To understand this thoroughly, let us take a
concrete illustration.</p>

<p>On a certain railroad there is a section, say from
X to Y, over which a local freight train has plied
daily for a number of years. Along this route there
are, perhaps, as many as fifty large foundries and
industrial plants, to attend to the requirements of
which this local freight was put on the road. The
conductor of this train has attended to this business
with satisfaction to his employers, and to the patrons
of the road, for three or four years. He thoroughly
understands the ins and outs of his route, all about
the different switches, side-tracks, dangerous places,
and difficulties that are to be encountered. He is
personally acquainted with the foremen of the different
establishments. He knows just what they
want and when they want it; he understands when
and where they want cars loaded and emptied. He
has the phraseology of the different side-tracks on
the tip of his tongue. When he arrives at any little
town, his switch list reads something like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Six for Dublin St.&#8221; &#8220;Two for Jerrys.&#8221; &#8220;Three
for The Middle.&#8221; &#8220;Seven for The Hole.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_127.jpg" width="50%" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A REAR-END COLLISION</p>

<p>In short, our conductor is the right man in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
right place. This is so not only from a business
point of view, but from the social aspect as well, for
he has made a home for himself, and all his social
interests are centred in a little town on this route.
But suddenly, without any warning or reason, he is
simply &#8220;bumped&#8221; out of the job, and a new man,
his senior, from another section of the road, takes
his place. This is an actual occurrence, and it is a
sad commentary on the straits to which some managements
are reduced. It shows the seniority principle
run into the ground. It is individualism triumphant.
Even to the whole body of employees it
is a distasteful proceeding. The senior man simply
&#8220;grabs the job,&#8221; and consequently twenty other
men are displaced in rotation, the management remaining
silent.</p>

<p>And yet there are men, even in high places, who
are prepared to defend this bumping principle. In
studying these railroad matters, and while calling
upon managers of different railroads, I was always
anxious to get the general opinions of the officials.
One can usually tell, from the &#8220;atmosphere&#8221; in
these offices, what can be expected in the way of
treatment of employees and so forth out on the
road. It was in order to get some of these impressions&mdash;some
of this silent information&mdash;that I
called upon the United States Commissioner of
Labor in Washington. I asked him for his opinion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
of the bumping principle. The commissioner was
outspoken in his defense of the bumping business;
in fact, he wished to know what possible objection
there could be to it. In so many words, and with
considerable emphasis, he inquired if it was not a
much more desirable state of affairs that the men
should be allowed to pick out their jobs in this way,
than that superintendents should be at liberty to
give the preference to their cousins, their brothers-in-law,
and other incompetents? In fact, managers
are not to be trusted. If I wished for evidence, I
could turn to the insurance scandals,&mdash;the cream
of the appointments handed over to relatives and
good-for-nothings. The commissioner was also of
the opinion that in only too many instances railroad
managers are in the habit of making rules which
they know only too well it is impossible for employees
to obey.</p>

<p>In the matter of the operating department, there
is an abundance of evidence of an interesting description.
What may in many ways be called abuse
of the management is a national habit of long standing.
In years gone by, this adverse criticism was
frequently only too well merited. But the time has
now come, in the interest of the public safety, for
some serious second thought on the subject. That
the habit still persists in the most unexpected
quarters, is a matter of easiest demonstration. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
the present day the Interstate Commerce Commission
is the laboratory in which all these railroad
questions are ground up, analyzed, classified, and
finally sent out in legal packages for public consumption.
With the idea of getting the &#8220;atmosphere&#8221;
of this department, I quite recently called
upon the secretary. He conducted me over the
premises, introduced me to everybody, and was
most kind and courteous in his attentions. He drew
my attention to a dozen or more framed and illuminated
testimonials, with which the walls of his
office were pretty well covered. The tenor of these
documents was all the same. Railroad men, telegraphers,
organizations and brotherhoods of laboring
men, from different sections of the country,
unanimously testified to their gratitude to the
secretary for his efforts and success in fighting their
battles and winning their victories. In a word, he
was their friend.</p>

<p>Remembering where I was, I thereupon looked
about me for testimonials from railroad officials or
corporations. I expected to see evidence of the
secretary&#8217;s interest and work in behalf of the manager&#8217;s
side of the problem, in relation, for instance,
to the bringing of men and managements together
in the interest of the public, for whose use and
benefit, as I look at it, railroads are operated. But
in this I was disappointed. My attention was then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
called to a number of pens, perhaps half a dozen,
with which sundry bills, in the interests of labor,
had been signed by different presidents. But one
side of the question was emphasized.</p>

<p>Finally, I was introduced into a room in which
were seated seven or eight of the railroad inspectors
employed by the commission. I had no sooner given
expression to my views, than I became aware that
I was getting into hot water. With one or two exceptions,
these men were of the opinion that I had
taken hold of the wrong end of the problem. It was
pointed out to me that superintendents and managers
nowadays are promoted from the wrong material.
The inspectors thought that the officials
were nearly always picked out of the clerical force,
instead of from practical, out-on-the-road men, such
as engineers and conductors. Consequently, in their
opinion, the managing departments all over the
country are sadly inefficient. As a result, a general
decapitation of incompetent superintendents is now
in order, and is the one thing needful to secure the
greatest possible degree of efficiency in the railroad
service.</p>

<p>For something like ten years altogether I have
devoted my spare time to the study of this safety
problem on our railroads. During this period I have
never received a word of advice, or encouragement,
or assistance to the extent of a copper, from any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
manager or from anybody connected with the management
of railroads. My incentive and encouragement
have proceeded in an entirely different way.
Some people are content to stand on their little
pedestals and watch the world go round. The energies
and thoughts of quite a number are absorbed
in the climbing of pay-rolls. Others, again, have
sensibilities that must be attended to. These touches
of nature should be cultivated. As the world runs
to-day, &#8220;business from the start means, only too
often, business to the finish.&#8221; I do not think that
the American people, the great business community,
at any rate, realizes either the nature or the extent of
these distressing accidents with sufficient acuteness.
In the rush of affairs, sensibility runs the risk of getting
smothered. There is a tendency to call upon
money and machinery to accomplish everything.</p>

<p>Finally, let me add that, apart from my opinions
on this railroad situation, or perhaps in spite of them,
I am the heartiest kind of an optimist. At the present
day, such splendid possibilities are latent in
every sphere of thought and action that one almost
trembles at the contemplation of them. Even now,
as it seems to me, every man in his little world may
be something of a Prospero, for every righteous
thought is a winged Ariel on highest mission.</p>

THE HUMAN EQUATION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> makes little difference what phase of the situation
between labor and management on American
railroads we choose to investigate, the supreme
importance of personality and personal responsibility
is impressed upon us at every turn. As with the
safety problem in the operating department, so with
all questions relating to piece-work and the bonus
system,&mdash;the principle at stake is not only the
absolute right, but the fundamental obligation, of
every man to do his level best under all circumstances,
just as truly and inevitably in the best interests
of a railroad as of human progress and civilization.
The story of the stifling of personality and
of the neglect of the human equation in American
industrial life, and on the railroads in particular,
will probably have to be related and insisted upon
over and over again before public opinion can be
brought to realize the widespread nature and importance
of the issue.</p>

<p>The principles involved in an ordinary preventable
accident on a railroad can be picked out and
followed through different stages of railroad life, all
the way up to the leveling process which, generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
speaking, the labor unions insist upon, in promotion
by seniority and in matters relating to mechanical
work in the railroad shops. The steps in the process
are all as plain and unmistakable as the rounds
of a ladder. Let us begin with one of the first appearances
or germs of the trouble.</p>

<p>A freight train is backed into a yard or side-track,
and by reason of rough handling or carelessness
a small collision occurs, and several cars loaded
with valuable merchandise are jammed down and
off the end of the track into the swamp. The superintendent
investigates the case and decides that
the engineman was guilty of rough and careless
handling. The engineman appeals from this decision,
claiming that a wrong motion was given by
the brakeman, or the brakes did not hold,&mdash;anyway
he appeals, and his contention is taken up and
supported by his organization. After weeks of discussion
and attempted arbitration, the whole business
is quietly dropped, because the men decline to
give in and the management, with the business interests
of a wide section of country in actual peril,
are not prepared to tie up the road and fight the
issue to a finish. It is useless to minimize the widespread
effect of this interference. I have given an
illustration of a principle that is at work on all railroads,
and, in the way I have described, the men
are furnished with a precedent, and the managers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
with a very good idea of the difficulties to be expected
in the future. So the manager now goes to
work and orders <i>bunters</i> put up at the end of these
tracks in all yards and sidings. He has been driven
to the conclusion that, although it may be out of
his power to teach and enforce carefulness and personal
responsibility, he can nevertheless put up
bunters which, when butted against, will act as
practical reminders in regard to the location of the
cars and the duties of the trainmen.</p>

<p>Although the incident described is merely a figurative
illustration, the <i>bunter principle</i> itself is of
widespread application, and to-day is practically the
mainstay and sheet anchor of the American railroad
manager. To a much greater extent than an outsider
would imagine, these bunters, derailing
switches, and other mechanical devices for the protection
of life and property, are, in the main, confessions
of weakness and indications that the personality
of the men along these particular lines has
been tried and found wanting.</p>

<p>As another illustration of our topic, but of a
somewhat different nature, let us now take a glance
at what is usually known as the a &#8220;Nine-Hour Law,&#8221;&mdash;more
especially in its application to telegraph
operators.</p>

<p>Twelve or fifteen hours at a stretch is too long a
period for any man or boy to remain in harness.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
As I look at it, the primary object of this law is, or
should be, to increase the efficiency of the service.
This is particularly desirable, for the reason that
some of the worst wrecks in the history of railroading
have been attributed to sleepy and careless telegraph
operators. But it by no means follows that,
because the law has increased the operator&#8217;s pay
and shortened his day&#8217;s work, it has also increased
his efficiency. You can depend upon a good man,
who works twelve hours at a stretch, while you can
place little reliance upon a shiftless fellow who is
called upon to work only nine. To increase efficiency
in any department or industry, you must touch or
act upon personality in some way. This giving of
something for nothing by the United States government
is at best a very questionable proceeding,
and it is a pity that the nine-hour law could not
have been framed with at least some reference to
merit, attention to duty, and length of service.
The man who works eight hours at high pressure
is much more likely to be overworked, and, generally
speaking, is more worthy of assistance than
the twelve-hour man, who may handle on an average
one message per hour, and consequently has
difficulty in keeping awake. Unprejudiced judges
are of the opinion that, as framed at present, the law
will have no effect whatever upon the efficiency of
the service. Of course the function of a railroad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
manager is to promote efficiency, but laws of this
description ignore the usual and constituted authority
and divert the attention of the employees
to their unions and to the national government.
But now we will take up this matter of personality
and the human equation from a vastly more important
point of view.</p>

<p>A very serious and somewhat remarkable accident
took place quite recently&mdash;an engine attached
to a passenger train ran into an open draw and
dropped thirty feet, leaving the tender and four
coaches, containing seventy-five passengers, on the
brink. The following day, in a report of this accident,
the Boston &#8220;Transcript&#8221; quoted President
Tuttle of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t open that draw, you can&#8217;t pull the
bolts that block it, until all signals are set for danger,
and they remain at danger while the draw is
open. They do not disappear until the draw is
closed and the signals for a clear track are set.
The engineman knew these signals were there,
and he knew what they meant. A railroad may
supply every safety device known to modern science
for precaution, it may put in the perfection of
safety appliances for the safety of its passengers
and its stock, but you can&#8217;t get by the <i>human equation</i>.
You&#8217;ve got to stop right there. You can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
only discharge the man and get another, and, in
turn, he is liable to do the same thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every word of the above statement of the president
of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad is true.
It is the conclusion of common sense, of the law,
and of the prophets on the subject. And yet the
criticism which I intend to apply to it is most damaging.</p>

<p>It is, alas, only too true that practically very
little good is accomplished by discharging a man
who runs a passenger train into an open draw. It
is simply a case of locking the stable door after the
horse has been stolen. But the principle of punishment
for offenses of this nature is universally recognized,
and in the matter of railroad accidents it
thus becomes the duty of the managers, supported
by public opinion, to see to it that this punishment
is inflicted at the right time and in the right place.
On a railroad, with human life and much valuable
property at stake, a system of discipline that does
not punish for trifles is a mockery. As a practical
matter of fact, all mistakes and accidents, without
serious consequences, can be written down as trifles;
and taking the situation in a wide sense, covering
all railroads, it is safe to say that there is no
power in the country to-day that is either able or
willing to discipline enginemen for trifles. When
a passenger train has been brought to the brink<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
of a draw, it is too late a day to apply your prevention
method.</p>

<p>The battle in regard to this matter has long ago
been fought and won by the men. The Brotherhood
of Locomotive Engineers is now in a position to tire
out any board of railroad management in the country.
The statement made in Faneuil Hall by a railroad
man, that in rush times the management will
&#8220;lap up any schedule that is placed before them,&#8221;
was no empty boast. The right of unlimited appeal
to be found in the schedules of the organizations
has knocked the ground from under the superintendent
and made the punishment for trifles a practical
impossibility. The public may just as well be
informed of the facts now as later. The men upon
whose vigilance and caution the safety of railroad
travel is altogether dependent are not being educated
in a school in which even the rudiments or
principles of safety are being taught or insisted
upon. That a great majority of railroad employees
are sound in their habits and thoroughly honest
and conscientious in their intentions, is not open
to question; but it is practically the fault of these
good men that the careless individuals are not subject
to discipline, and so cannot be weeded out before
the day of reckoning. But, as a matter of fact,
the system is almost as fatal to the best man as
to the worst, and in the words of President Tuttle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
&#8220;You can discharge a man and get another, and,
in turn, he is liable to do the same thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Furthermore, however unpalatable the truth may
be, it is nevertheless an unquestionable fact that the
American railroad man, above all others, is most
in need of an inflexible system of discipline. The
reasons are obvious. To begin with, the railroad
man is a typical American. He is fearless, quick,
clever, and resourceful. He cuts loose, only too
easily, from custom and tradition. He has supreme
confidence in his own individual importance and
ability. In unmistakable quality and quantity he
is in possession of the sterling characteristics that
have made the American the most resourceful antagonist
by land or sea, the cleverest designer and
inventor, the most fearless innovator and reformer,
and the poorest railroad man, from the safety standpoint,
in the world to-day.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more simple than the explanation
of this paradox. In the mental composition of
the American railroad man there is no such idea
or faculty as <i>dogged obedience</i>. And yet it must be
evident to the most superficial thinker on this subject
that never can there be any prospect for, or
approach to, safety in railroad travel, without this
indispensable ingredient of personal character. It
is the <i>sine qua non</i> of successful railroad operation.
&#8220;Theirs not to reason why&#8221; is the solution of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
safety problem in a single forceful expression. And
yet in a lifetime of railroad service, I can honestly
affirm that I never met more than half a dozen railroad
men who had any conception, either in theory
or practice, of this principle of dogged obedience.
Furthermore, I never came across a manager who
was big enough to preach the doctrine, and I am
equally certain I have never read in the newspapers
or magazines any widespread expression of public
opinion that would lead a railroad manager to expect
public support and approval of any such principle.
Consequently, my argument is an arraignment
not only of the men, the unions, and the
managements, but of the manifest opinion and public
policy of the American people. The price that
is being paid in tribute to this lack of dogged obedience
and its attendant evils is graphically emphasized
in the Twenty-first Annual Report of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, issued December
23, 1907, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Accidents to trains on the railroads in the
United States continue to occur in such large
numbers that the record, as has been repeatedly
declared by conservative judges, is a world-wide
reproach to the railroad profession in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>That the men should lack the faculty I speak
of is not, under the circumstances, so very surprising;
but that a great many railroad managers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
as well, should remain uncertain and doubtful as
to its fundamental importance, is by no means so
easy to understand. Some time ago the writer of
this essay received in writing, from the head of
the operating department of one of our largest railroad
systems, the following question:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it not equally essential that the meaning of
and reason for a rule should be evident on its face
as that the rule itself, that is, its wording, should
be plain and unmistakable?&#8221;</p>

<p>My reply was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;By no means. From the safety standpoint the
order itself is primary; the reason for its being in
the time-table is secondary. Is it not very significant
that the principle of dogged obedience should
be open to question on a railroad, while, in the
case of a city ordinance or a state law, no liberty
of thought or action in such matters is tolerated
for a minute?&#8221;</p>

<p>The following illustration is interesting and well
to the point:&mdash;</p>

<p>In our time-tables we have a rule for the guidance
of enginemen on what are called &#8220;helping engines,&#8221;
which reads something like this: &#8220;Never hang up
the numbers of the train you are going to help on
your headlight, until you are actually hitched on
to said train.&#8221; The reason for this rule does not
appear on its face, and yet the rigid necessity for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
dogged obedience in regard to it will at once be
understood, when we study its origin.</p>

<p>About twenty years ago, while working as telegraph
operator at East Deerfield, Mass., I received
a telegram ordering an extra engine out of the
round-house to help a regular freight train, No. 94,
which was expected in from the east. Meanwhile
the helping engine stood waiting on a siding with
&#8220;94&#8221; displayed on its headlight. Before long an
extra or &#8220;wild&#8221; freight train from the west, with
orders to meet No. 94 at East Deerfield on single
track, came along, and, mistaking the engine with
&#8220;94&#8221; on its headlight for the regular train, kept
on its way without stopping. No. 94 and this wild
freight met in a cut, and &#8220;piled up&#8221; in probably
the worst &#8220;head-on&#8221; freight collision in the history
of the old Fitchburg Railroad.</p>

<p>Every rule in the time-table has its history written
in suffering and dollars; and while, of course,
it is advisable for employees to be conversant with
their meaning and significance, it is evident that
the principle of dogged obedience is the only safe
method for employees to pursue in regard to them.
An inflexible enforcement of this principle would
be looked upon as little short of tyranny; and yet,
seriously and fairly considered, it is nothing but
the subordination which every railroad man owes
to the community in the interest of safety and general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
efficiency. That the organizations of railroad
men do not insist upon, or even countenance, this
absolute subordination to authority, is thoroughly
understood by every man and manager in the service.
We are all tarred with the same brush, and
rather than acknowledge the weakness of our position,
we prefer to keep calling on the public to pay
the penalty. It is time to call a halt when the liberty
and liberal views of a few endanger the safety
of the many.</p>

<p>But in passing from this branch of my subject, I
wish to call attention to an almost unnoticed fact
in regard to the efficiency of railroad service. Taking
an accident bulletin, issued by the Interstate
Commerce Commission, at random, I copy the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The total number of collisions and derailments
during April, May, and June, 1907, was 3777, of
which 220 collisions and 221 derailments affected
passenger trains. The damage to cars, engine,
and roadway by these accidents amounted to
$3,232,673.&#8221;</p>

<p>This report, treating as it does exclusively of
collisions and derailments, is serious enough, but
the note that is appended to it is the significant
feature of the situation:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Collisions and derailments which cause no death
or personal injury, and which cause not over $150.00<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
damage to the property of the railroad, are not
reported.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing that the public should be in possession of
all the facts in regard to efficiency of service, it
occurs to me that a list of narrow escapes and of
collisions and derailments which cause no deaths
or personal injury, would make very interesting
reading. These are the very &#8220;trifles&#8221; to which I
have already called attention. They are the seed
from which we reap our crop of disasters. They
are well worth reporting and paying attention to,
and no annual or other statement of the situation
on the railroad is worth much if it fails to recognize
the significance of this feature.</p>

<p>But apart from the influence and power of the
railroad organization upon the individuality and personal
conduct of its members in relation to train
wrecks and discipline, there is another branch of
the topic that is perhaps still more interesting,
from a human and national point of view.</p>

<p>Comparatively speaking, public attention has been
but slightly directed in any specific way to the
matter of accidents to employees on American
railroads. It is certainly one of the most distressing
features to be studied in connection with the
safety problem. Collisions, derailments, defective
hand-holds and brake apparatus, and the like, cause
injuries to great numbers of employees. For example,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
at Haverhill, N. H., the other day, five employees
were instantly killed, through the alleged carelessness
or oversight of a fellow employee. Such
instances, of course, are particularly painful topics
for discussion among railroad men, and yet this
is the kind of an accident one reads about in
the newspapers almost daily. But in twenty-four
hours the reading public will forget the very worst
of these accidents to employees. Their frequency
takes the edge off their significance. During the
year 1907, on a single American railroad, 104 employees
were killed outright, and 3575 were injured.
The cost of these accidents to the railroad in question
was something like $285,000. With an employers&#8217;
liability law in force and operation, as in
countries abroad, the increase in total paid to employees
alone on this road would have carried the
aggregate to half a million dollars. The magnitude
and importance of the safety problem in relation to
employees is still more evident when we consider
that for the year ending June 30, 1907, the casualty
list on American railroads shows a total of all persons
killed, from all causes, of 5000, and injured
72,286; the totals for employees alone being 4353
killed and 62,687 injured.</p>

<p>The following figures in regard to actual train accidents
and the casualties resulting therefrom show
a rather discouraging state of affairs, from the fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
that the employees themselves were in the main
responsible for them. In 1904 the killed and injured
employees in train accidents numbered 7834; in
1905, 7850; in 1906, 8362; and in 1907, 9935. As
with all other items, so with accidents to employees,
the total of casualties has largely increased year by
year.</p>

<p>But one of the most distressing features to be
considered in connection with accidents to employees,
whether caused by their own carelessness
or otherwise, is the absolute indifference with which
news and statistics of such casualties <i>appear</i> to be
received by the average railroad man. So far as an
impartial investigator would be able to discover,
&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad&#8221; is about the limit of criticism and
action in such matters. The indifference I call attention
to, so far as the minds of the employees are
concerned, is not real, and the actual reason and
history of the seeming neglect can easily be located
and analyzed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_149.jpg" width="50%" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">WHAT COMES FROM A MISPLACED SWITCH</p>

<p>The railroad employee, as a unit, is whole-souled
and sympathetic; not a suspicion of indifference
can be imputed to him, either as a man or as a
brother. Individually speaking, when a passenger
or an employee is injured, there is no sorrow like
his sorrow; but, unfortunately, the organizations
or machines through which alone his desires and
sympathies can be expressed, have never shown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
any disposition to interest themselves in any practical
way in matters relating to the safety of the
public, or of the employees, <i>whenever such interest
is liable to develop into a probe of the conduct and
efficiency of the railroad man</i>. The heads of the national
organizations of railroad men, with particular
reference to those connected with the operating
department, occupy positions that are usually three-quarters
political. The wishes and sentiments of
great majorities of employees on certain railroads
can be, and have been, set aside by the political
shake of the head of one man in Washington or
Chicago. The acquiescence of the rank and file in
this state of affairs is paid for in legislation and
concessions. Nevertheless, from the human and
social point of view, it would seem as if the organizations,
or men-machines as we may call them,
should bestir themselves in this matter of accidents
to their members. In order to do this, co&ouml;peration
with the management is necessary; so
the following questions very naturally arise:&mdash;</p>

<p>By consultation, or otherwise, has any personality
been put into the business? Have our organizations
ever said to their members, &#8220;Come, boys, let us
reason together: when a man runs a signal, or disobeys
orders, it is a disgrace to our machine. In
reality we, the employees, are the principal stock-holders
in a railroad. When passengers, or our own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
members, are killed or injured, we have to pay a
large proportion of the bill. We pay in loss of prestige
and character, and every time one of us makes
a mistake, it is a blot on our &#8217;scutcheon. We should
see to it that this matter is made personal to every
member of our organization. We should co&ouml;perate
with managers in locating the blame for these accidents,
and, without regard to consequences, we
should insist upon the removal of offenders.&#8221;</p>

<p>Is there any evidence to show that this is the
actual state of affairs? If so, I have yet to meet a
man who is aware of it. But, on the other hand, if
no such influence is being exerted by the organizations,
in all candor, and in the name of public safety,
I ask, why not? For, right here, the public puts in
its appearance and the following additional question
must forthwith be answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>Are our organizations prepared to say to the
public, &#8220;We are sorry, but the fact is, our machine
is constructed purely upon selfish principles. Our
time and efforts are exclusively occupied in fencing
with the management. When passengers, even our
own brothers, are killed, it is up to the superintendent
every time. Let him change the rules if he
thinks fit, but according to precedent and the rules
of our organization in such cases, we are not expected
to show any signs of sympathy or humanity.
Consequently, to all interests apart from what may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
be called the political welfare of the whole machine,
we are deaf, dumb, and blind?&#8221;</p>

<p>Is this an overdrawn picture? I think not. It is
simply a truthful matter-of-fact description of railroad
organizations, from whose calculations and
behavior the personal and sympathetic element in
regard to these safety questions has been eliminated.</p>

<p>But now, widening our horizon a little, we have
next to take note that these questions of personal
character, personal responsibility, and unhampered
personal effort, are real and intense problems for
thoughtful people to study, not only in relation to
preventable accidents, but in every department of
railroad life.</p>

<p>Some time ago, in an issue of the &#8220;Engineering
Magazine,&#8221; a note of warning was sounded
against the result of certain American manufacturing
methods. It was pointed out that the principle
of securing the largest output of uniform
character, at minimum cost, made automata of the
operatives, and discouraged skilled and trained
artisans to so great an extent that the quality of the
men to-day, for lack of proper inspiration, was generally
poor and unreliable. According to the opinion
expressed in the article that I refer to, many
American manufacturers are beginning to realize
the necessity of attracting men of high character
to their employ, of surrounding them with an environment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
tending towards sobriety, integrity, and
industry, and rewarding them according to their
efforts, in order to avoid the effects of this so-called
&#8220;American tendency.&#8221;</p>

<p>That American methods of conducting business
should be considered retrogressive, on account of
lack or poverty of inspiration, certainly points to
unhealthy conditions somewhere. If these American
tendencies can be shown to have the effect
of discouraging individual effort and the natural
growth and ambition of the worker on railroads or
elsewhere, the matter certainly calls for serious attention.
To say the least of it, it betokens a very
peculiar state of affairs, for the reason that if there
be one characteristic that more than another distinguishes
the American citizen from the rest of
the world, it is his freedom of personal action, his
propensity for striking new and unexplored trails in
almost every branch of research, industry, and invention.
The American is <i>par excellence</i> the world&#8217;s
inventor. And yet, without the utmost liberty of
thought and action, an inventor would cut but a
sorry figure. It follows, therefore, that any curtailment
of or interference with these distinctively
American gifts and instincts will, as they say, bear
watching.</p>

<p>Quite a number of years ago an American firm
secured a contract for the erection of a large factory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
somewhere near Manchester, England. The
contractor soon discovered that no persuasion or
encouragement would induce the British workman
to lay more than a certain number of bricks per
hour, according to the fixed law and schedule of
his union. In order to complete the work within
the allotted time, the contractor was compelled to
send for American bricklayers. These men, who
were paid according to their industry and personal
effort, were able to lay four bricks to the Englishman&#8217;s
one. The American could beat the Englishman
four to one, not because he was, to that extent,
a cleverer and quicker workman, but because
at that time and place he was a free man. Transferred
to American shops and factories, and in a
different atmosphere, the foreign workman easily
adapts himself to conditions and is able to hold
his own.</p>

<p>According to the writer in the &#8220;Engineering
Magazine,&#8221; American manufacturers are taking
measures to stimulate and revive the principle of
individual effort, in order to secure excellence in
workmanship; but, according to other authorities,
these efforts are being counteracted by the labor
unions on the railroads and elsewhere, which appear
to be following in the footsteps and adopting
the methods of the British organizations. However,
the ideas and ideals of many wide-awake manufacturers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
and managers have found practical exemplification
in various manufacturing establishments,
as well as in railroad shops in different parts of the
country.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best field for a short consideration
of this interesting subject, so far as railroads are
concerned, is to be found on the Santa F&eacute; Railroad
system. The introduction of the individual-effort
reward or bonus system of stimulating employees
to extra or unusual effort, and of compensating
them suitably therefor, is probably the most important
of all the betterment work on this railroad.
The inauguration of the system followed the strike
of the machinists, boiler-makers, and blacksmiths,
in May, 1904. The credit for its introduction on
the Santa F&eacute; is due to Mr. J. W. Kendrick, Second
Vice-President. Mr. Charles H. Fry, associate
editor of the &#8220;Railroad Gazette,&#8221; who has written
a valuable and comprehensive report of this betterment
work, gives the following as its principal features
and objects:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;To restore and promote cordial relations, based
on mutual respect and confidence, between employer
and employee;</p>

<p>&#8220;To restore the worker to himself by freeing him
from the small and debasing tyrannies of petty and
arbitrary officials on the one side, and from individuality-destroying
union domination on the other;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>&#8220;To give the company better, more reliable, and
more trustworthy employees;</p>

<p>&#8220;To increase automatically, and without fixed
limit, the pay of good men, this increase of pay depending
on themselves and not on their immediate
superiors;</p>

<p>&#8220;To increase the capacity of the shops without
adding new equipment;</p>

<p>&#8220;To increase the reliability of work turned out
and the efficiency of operation performed;</p>

<p>&#8220;To do all these things, not only without cost to
the company, but with a marked reduction in its
expenses.&#8221;</p>

<p>The programme was certainly ambitious and
praiseworthy, and in Mr. Fry&#8217;s report the results,
after a thorough trial extending over several years,
are given in the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can safely be said that the betterment work
<i>has</i> resulted as anticipated in restoring harmony
between employer and employee, in restoring self-respect
to the latter and increasing his efficiency
and reliability. Also it has raised his wages ten to
twenty per cent on the average. In addition, for
every dollar of supervising and special expense incurred,
the company has saved at least ten dollars
in reduced costs.&#8221;</p>

<p>But just here two very important points require
to be noticed and emphasized. In the operations of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
a railroad, efficiency must never be sacrificed for
the sake of economy, and on the Santa F&eacute; Railroad,
when questions arise in which there is even the
remote possibility of impairment of efficiency, all
economical propositions or arrangements are at
once postponed or vetoed altogether. Again, it is
manifest that as a result of the improved methods
and greater individual effort, certain reductions in
working force will become possible. In regard to
this matter the Santa F&eacute; management claims that
such reduction, when necessary, can easily be effected,
simply by not replacing men who naturally
drop out. This has been their uniform policy, and
therefore, from their point of view, there is no possible
ground for objection by employees on that
score.</p>

<p>The individual-effort reward system on the Santa
F&eacute; thus far has been limited to the maintenance of
equipment and to locomotive operation. The labor
employed in the shops is, of course, distinctly non-union.
The saving effected under these methods
on tools and machinery alone, at Topeka, was
$119,000, and the total economy on 1633 locomotives
(repairs and renewals) for the year 1906
amounted to $1,737,626. These facts and figures
are derived from a comparison of the cost of actual
and identically similar work before and after the
inauguration of the bonus system.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>It is impossible at this time to enter into a minute
explanation or description of the system which is
to-day in actual operation on the Santa F&eacute; Railroad,
and under which satisfactory results, both to employer
and employee, are being obtained. The work
itself is notable not so much because of its economical
results as on account of its moral and sociological
aspects. Without taking any side in the
questions at all, it is evident that the movement and
work on the Santa F&eacute;, from beginning to end, has
been an appeal to individual effort and character, and
a protest against the recognized ideals of the labor
unions. But it will not be found necessary to go into
details of the Santa F&eacute; system in order to illustrate
and emphasize the principles that are at stake and
the nature of the problem that must, before long, be
settled, one way or the other, by an educated and
enlightened public opinion.</p>

<p>On the Santa F&eacute; Railroad, prior to the installation
of the bonus system, a vast number of time-studies
had to be made and schedules prepared.
Every operation or piece of work to be bonused
had to be studied by competent men, to determine,
from the machine and other conditions, a fair or
standard time to apply to it. Thousands of such
studies have been made at the Topeka shops, and
properly recorded and preserved on regular blanks.</p>

<p>The following illustrations are only partially descriptive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
of the Santa F&eacute; method, but they are sufficiently
accurate to cover the principles involved,
the benefits that are derived from them, and some
of the objections which have been advanced by the
union men on the railroads, who are opposed to the
bonus system in any form.</p>

<p>You take a certain piece of machinery, say a part
of a locomotive. You make a &#8220;study&#8221; of this part.
After making one hundred tests, under all sorts of
conditions, you make a schedule in your machine-shop
for this particular operation or piece of work.
You then fix upon a standard time for doing this
work. Standard time is simply the time which it
ought reasonably to take to do the work without
killing effort, but by eliminating every unnecessary
waste. The elimination of waste is the fair and
square proposition you present to your workman.
You say to him, &#8220;Make a standard time on this
piece of machinery, and I will pay you twenty per
cent above your hourly rate, that is, above your
regular pay. If you take more than standard time,
your bonus will diminish until at fifty per cent above
standard time it will simply merge into your day
rate. On the other hand, if less than standard time
is taken, your bonus will increase above twenty per
cent. But, under any conditions or circumstances,
you will always receive your full day&#8217;s wage.&#8221;</p>

<p>The situation becomes still plainer, if you explain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
it to your workman in this way. You say to him,
&#8220;During the past year I have watched your work
closely, and made hundreds of &#8216;studies&#8217; in regard
to the &#8216;part&#8217; you turn out with that machine. I find
that you have averaged about six to the hour. Now
I am convinced that you can just as well turn out
seven. Your pay is now $2.50 per day; if in the
future you can make seven instead of six of these
&#8216;parts&#8217; in an hour, I will pay you $3.00 per day. In
fact, your pay will increase in exact proportion to
your cleverness and industry. Furthermore, if by
any manner or means you can invent a way, such,
for instance, as an improvement in the mechanism
or in the operation of your machine whereby you
are enabled to turn out a dozen of these &#8216;parts&#8217; in
an hour, I will see to it that your pay is increased
accordingly, without any limit whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Continuing our general illustration, we will now
take it for granted that you are able to start this
bonus system in your factory or shop, in which,
under ordinary circumstances, you give employment
to one hundred union men. At the end of a certain
period you find, on account of the extra effort put
forth by the most ambitious and cleverest men,
that the number of these &#8220;parts&#8221; which you require
in your business, or on your railroad, can easily
be turned out by seventy-five men. So without delay
you reduce the working force in your shop accordingly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
It matters not how you do this, whether
by simple discharge or by omitting to fill vacancies
as they occur in a natural way, the fact remains
that at the end of the year you have decreased your
force twenty-five per cent, and besides, without adding
to your equipment, you have made a substantial
reduction in your operating expenses.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the men who have lost their jobs have
lodged a complaint with their union, and you are
soon confronted with a grievance committee. These
gentlemen inform you that the bonus system is all
wrong, from beginning to end. From the union
standpoint they will explain to you that the idea is,
not to offer a reward for quickest and best work,
nor to encourage the best men to get rich quick, or
to vaunt their superiority over their duller and less
fortunate comrades, but to make the job, whatever
it may be, last as long as possible, and thus to afford
employment to the greatest number of workers, at
a fair and fixed rate of wages to every individual,
regardless of ability or ambition, or of the profits
and interests of the establishment. You are further
informed that the grievance committee cannot enter
into the discussion of ethical and sociological questions.
The race is doing pretty well as a whole, and
posterity will accord to labor its due share of credit.
Meanwhile the men will be called out of your shop,
and the issue between the bonus system of reward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
for individual effort and the leveling process in
shop-work will be fought to a finish.</p>

<p>Take another illustration: You make a great
many &#8220;studies&#8221; in relation to the use of oil and
other supplies on a locomotive on your railroad.
You arrive at a fair standard of expense. You conclude
there must be considerable waste going on
somewhere, so you say to the engine crews, &#8220;So
much per month is a fair average of expense for
such and such tools and supplies on your engine.
If you can lower this average, we will share the
amount saved in this way.&#8221; So you put the system
in force on one thousand locomotives and save
thereby four thousand dollars per month, which
you divide with the men. But in doing this you
have increased the pay of the careful men, and done
nothing for those who are not interested in the general
welfare of your railroad. The grievance committee
takes the matter up with you; it protests
against the whole business, and puts forth the argument
that it is a dangerous proceeding, for you are
guilty of encouraging a certain class of men to let
engines &#8220;run hot&#8221; in order that they may secure
your bonus for economy. In a word, you are requested
to put a stop to this phase of your bonus
system on the railroad.</p>

<p>Regardless of my somewhat crude and incomplete
method of explaining the working of a bonus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
system on a railroad, my illustrations afford a very
good idea of the Santa F&eacute; system, which is in successful
operation at the present day, as well as the
proposed plans of the New York, New Haven &amp;
Hartford management, which quite recently the
labor unions compelled the railroad to abandon.</p>

<p>But apart from successful operation in one quarter
and defeat in another, the principles at stake in
this bonus system are of world-wide interest and
importance. Bearing this in mind, a few direct and
pertinent questions have occurred to me, which I
submit for the thoughtful consideration of my fellow
workers on the railroads, as well as of liberty-loving
people everywhere.</p>

<p>In the interest of human progress, and in particular
with a view to efficiency of railroad service, do
you think a railroad man should be permitted and
encouraged to do his level best under all circumstances?
Would you recognize and promote individual
effort and good work in your sawmill, if you
owned one, for the good of the business and in the
interest of your pocketbook? Would you recognize
and promote individual effort, attention to duty, and
efficiency of service on a railroad, understanding, as
you do, that upon these personal characteristics the
welfare of the railroad and the safety of the traveling
public are almost wholly dependent? Again,
would you hesitate to encourage and reward the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
economical administration of the affairs of your own
town or your sawmill, for fear lest the departments
or the machinery might be deliberately ruined by
employees, or by your fellow townsmen, in their
efforts to secure said reward and encouragement?</p>

<p>If, after painstaking experiment, you become convinced
that the plan would result in benefit to the
interests of both management and men, would you
hesitate to offer a bonus, or reward on co&ouml;perative
principles, as an incentive to the economical use of
supplies on a locomotive, for fear lest unprincipled
engine crews should play tricks with the engine in
order to secure the bonus?</p>

<p>Furthermore, if the encouragement of the best
men and the best service can be shown to work
against the interests of second-class men and poorer
service, would you be willing, on a railroad, to sacrifice
these second-class men and their interests, in
so far as this action should become necessary, to
secure the greatest possible efficiency for the safeguarding
of the traveling public?</p>

<p>Finally, in the history of the development and
civilization of the human race, is it possible to point
to a single item of real progress, efficiency, or
achievement, that has not been the direct result of
the sacrifice of something below to the more important
interests of something above?</p>

<p>Does it not therefore follow that any legislation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
or labor movement that has the effect of checking
individual effort, or of interfering in any way with
the free play of the best that is in any man, must
necessarily reduce the standard and ideals of labor?
for such movements are an inversion of the laws of
progress, and at the same time a reflection on the
best thought and tradition of the American people.</p>

DISCIPLINE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the present day, public attention is being constantly
aroused and focused upon all questions that
immediately concern the general welfare of the people.
In this way the efficiency of the service on
American railroads has, of late, been freely discussed,
not only by railroad men, but by thoughtful
people in all the walks of life. The reason for this
universal interest is to be found in the fact that an
inquiry into an ordinary preventable railroad accident
entails, at the same time, a study of the actual
working conditions that exist in America between
the rights and interests of the workingman, and
the more important rights and interests of the general
public. Of course, figures and tables in regard
to efficiency of service cannot always be taken at
their face value, and yet the conclusions that one
is sometimes compelled to draw from them are altogether
too significant to be lightly dismissed from
the public mind.</p>

<p>For example, in the year 1906, a total of 1,200,000,000
passengers was carried on British railroads
on 27,000 miles of track, against 800,000,000 passengers
carried on American railroads on a mileage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
of 200,000. Generally speaking, collisions and derailments
form quite a reliable standard from which
to make comparisons in regard to efficiency of service.
It must also be remembered that the chances
for accidents are naturally increased with increase
of traffic and consequent multiplication of train
movements. One might reasonably expect, therefore,
to find the density of conditions in Great
Britain reflected in a startling list of fatalities, as
compared with the United States. Yet if we take
the year 1906 to illustrate our theories and anticipated
conclusions, we find that there were 13,455
collisions and derailments in this country, and only
239 in Great Britain. In the same year 146 passengers
were killed and 6000 injured in the United
States, against 58 passengers killed and 631 injured
in Great Britain. The number of employees killed
and injured in train accidents was respectively 13
and 140 in Great Britain, against 879 and 7483 in
this country.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_169.jpg" width="50%" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">DOWN AN EMBANKMENT IN WINTER</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that figures and
returns like the above, repeated from year to year
with the same marked and, indeed, ever-increasing
disparity, should give rise to widespread discussion
and criticism, consequently leading up to a better
understanding of the nature of the problem that is
now submitted, with all necessary facts and illustrations,
practically for the first time, to the American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
people. For it must be understood, to begin
with, that, from its very nature and from the circumstances
connected with the safety problem, the
intervention of public opinion and of some kind of
public action is imperatively called for. Numerous
difficulties, mistakes, and inconsistencies relating to
the handling of trains, to the conduct of employees,
and to the present status of the railroad manager,
have been exposed and explained during the course
of these confessions. But, after all, these are merely
side issues and details of the service; the real heart
of the situation, as insisted upon from first to last
in these pages, is significantly outlined in a recent
issue of the &#8220;Engineering Magazine,&#8221; as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Even more serious, as a predisposing cause of
railroad accidents, is the lamentable lack of discipline,
which is becoming increasingly manifest in
these days of labor-union interference. This has
been carried to such a point that the officials of
our railroads have no longer that direct control of
the employees which is absolutely essential to the
maintenance of discipline. Until this condition has
been changed it is hopeless to look for any material
reduction in the number of killed and injured on
our railroads.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such, then, being the truthful and logical diagnosis
of the situation, the final and most important
question of all remains to be considered. From individuals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
in no way connected with railroad life, as
well as from employees and managers in different
sections of the country, the general interest in the
matter has been expressed in the following inquiries:
&#8220;What are you now going to do about it?
Granting this and granting that, what is your plan
of construction or reconstruction? What can you
propose as a practical method of reform?&#8221;</p>

<p>After a careful review and consideration of the
conditions that obtain on American railroads at the
present day, these significant and final questions,
in the opinion of the writer, must all be answered
in terms of <i>external authority</i>. It is really too bad
to have to come to the conclusion that no reform
can be expected, or indeed is possible, from within.
The men, the organizations, and the managements
must now be called upon to submit to publicity and
to correction, to be administered by the stern arm
of the law. A proper adjustment of the interests of
the men and the management, with a view to the
safety of travel, is, under present conditions, absolutely
impossible.</p>

<p>Ample opportunity and time have been afforded
these parties to solve the safety problem between
themselves, without outside interference. The Canadian
government has already come to the conclusion
that it is useless to wait any longer, and accordingly
it has taken measures to safeguard the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
rights of the traveling public. In like manner, just
as soon as the government of the United States
arrives at the same conclusion and sees fit to designate
carelessness on a railroad as a crime, punishable
in the same way as carelessness in driving
horses or automobiles on a crowded thoroughfare,
a revolution will take place in the service on American
railroads. When the management and the men
are called upon to face public examination and public
criticism, there will be no more hair-splitting in
the interpretation and administration of discipline.
The men and the management will then very quickly
recognize the necessity of adjusting their differences
and combining their forces in the interests
of the public. In a word, <i>authority</i> will become supreme,
and it will not take long for it to assert
itself in terms of effectual discipline. Such, according
to my view of it, is the only possible solution
of the safety problem on American railroads.</p>

<p>All other topics and questions, although closely
related to the problem, are in reality merely matters
of detail. For example, the lack of adequate
supervision means, of course, unchecked negligence,
and points the way to no end of trouble; and yet
the most comprehensive system of supervision imaginable
would be of little use, unsupported by a reasonable
and effective system of discipline. While,
therefore, my opinion as to the immediate necessity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
for the intervention of the national government
holds good, a general description of the American
method of discipline, upon which the efficiency of
the service is, in the mean time, absolutely dependent,
should nevertheless prove interesting to all
classes of readers.</p>

<p>To a great extent, a system of discipline represents
a state of mind, the ideals of an individual
or of a community, and sometimes, under certain
special conditions, an economical habit or business
necessity. In the old countries of Europe, where
the public interests smother individual rights as
well as the schedules of labor organizations, the
railroads have taken for their motto, &#8220;He that
sinneth shall die.&#8221; Cassio, faithful and true, with
an honorable and spotless record in the public
service, falls from grace in an unguarded moment,
and is sorrowfully yet absolutely doomed to dismissal
by the high-minded Othello. &#8220;Nevermore
be officer of mine.&#8221; Such in spirit, and, to a great
extent, in actual railroad life, is the European interpretation
of discipline. The European officials work
upon the plan, and with the unswerving determination
to protect the traveling public at all costs.
The record of accidents on their railroads leaves little
doubt as to the correctness of their methods of
railroading. On the other hand, in the United States,
the railroad manager, backed to a certain extent by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
public opinion, says to an offending employee,
&#8220;Your sin has enlightened and purified you, go back
to your job.&#8221; This is the mental method of discipline.
A man is called upon to think, without at
the same time being called upon to feel.</p>

<p>On a railroad nowadays, when a &#8220;green&#8221; man
makes a mistake, he is quietly informed by his
superintendent that five or ten demerit marks have
been placed against his name on the record book.
The shock he receives on the commission of his
first mistake is not very striking. He has perhaps
been called upon to think, but in order to give his
thoughts pungency and direction, he should also
have been called upon to feel. Good habits are induced
by feeling plus thought much more surely
and expeditiously than by thought alone. Feeling
plus thought is the scientific route. Some day,
perhaps, thought alone will prove sufficient, but a
railroad is no place to experiment with Utopian
possibilities. What is necessary is the best and
quickest way to originate good habits. The whole
nervous system in man is first organized by habit.
The feeling plus thought method of discipline is
humane as well as scientific, and is the most potent
instigator and prompter of habit.</p>

<p>According to Webster, discipline is &#8220;subjection
to severe and systematic training.&#8221; In the American
method of discipline on railroads, there is no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
systematic training of any kind; sensation or feeling
plays no part in it, and thought is left to take
care of itself.</p>

<p>Theoretically, the mental process has a good
deal to be said in its favor; but in actual operation
the system has proved to be disastrous, and the
records on American railroads illustrate only too
eloquently the fallacy of the principle, under any
conditions, where human lives are at stake. It is
simply a question between the ethics and philosophy
of Portia, and the blind impartiality of Othello as
applied to the railroad business. In social affairs
and in relation to conduct between individuals, the
standards of Portia are gracious and commendable;
but on a battleship, in the army, and just as surely
on a railroad, the services of the rugged Othello
will be found at all times to be the most effectual.
In the United States, however, there is a certain
altruistic sentiment that would fain submerge the
ethics and principles of the old-time disciplinarian.
Not only does this criticism apply to affairs on a
railroad, but our educational methods, in every direction,
seem to be threatened with the same peril.
On all sides there now appears to be a disinclination
to use authority. There seems to be something
in the nature of a national kick against constraint
or discipline of any kind. The ideals and rugged
characteristics of American manhood, both on railroads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
and in our schools, are threatened with the
coddling process.</p>

<p>Within the last ten or fifteen years, many railroads
have changed or modified their system of
discipline, as a tribute, in part, to this popular sentiment.
Perhaps in making these changes the managers
did the best they could under the circumstances.
They found themselves fast losing the
backing and authority necessary to enforce the old
system, and the new method was at least a working
arrangement with harmony for its basis.</p>

<p>A great majority of the railroads of the United
States are now using some sort of a merit system
in the administration of discipline. Most of these
methods are adaptations of the Brown system,
which was invented by Mr. G. R. Brown, at one
time vice-president of the Pennsylvania. Brown
figured it out for himself, while he was taking all
the steps from trainman up, on the Fall Brook Railroad;
and when he got to be general manager he
put it in on his road. The system, as modified by
most of the roads, is a sort of bookkeeping, with
debits and credits in the shape of marks, to the account
of each man. Generally speaking, a perfect
record for any term of years may not be entered
as a credit item in the book, although conspicuous
instances of heroism or devotion to duty are sometimes
noted. But a perfect record for a certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
period will wipe out previous debits. An employee
has access to his record book at any time, otherwise
the record is kept in absolute secrecy. On some
roads &#8220;rolls of honor&#8221; are kept and published, usually
in the railroad magazines. The names of the
men, together with an account of the meritorious
action, receive special mention. But, on the other
hand, there is no mention, either of names or particulars,
in regard to the debits when employees
make mistakes.</p>

<p>Railroad managers appear to be satisfied with
this Brown system of discipline, and the statement
has repeatedly appeared in the public prints that the
adoption of these rules has resulted in better service
to the companies. So far as the safety of travel and
the general efficiency of the service are concerned,
the figures and reports issued periodically by the
Interstate Commerce Commission are calculated to
convey a very different impression. Railroad officials
inform us that the Brown system is an attempt
to promote good feeling between the men and the
management. This is doubtless true, but the statement
lets the cat out of the bag. The employee
appreciates the fact that the sting is extracted from
a reprimand when it is administered in secret.
Doubtless, if the sole aim has been to secure harmonious
relations between men and management,
little fault can be found with the Brown system;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
but it appears in a somewhat different light when
we study it in relation to the safety problem.</p>

<p>For example, a man makes a serious mistake,
without actual injury to persons or damage to property.
He is punished to the extent of ten demerit
marks. In the course of a few months five or six
other men commit the same mistake. In every instance
a secret record of the mistake has been kept.
When a mistake remains unchecked, sooner or later
it arrives at the epidemic stage and reaches its
climax in a wreck, and then finally a man is discharged
for it. The demerit marks have had no corrective
or preventive effect whatever. Under this
system the trouble is allowed to evolve in a natural
way, from a simple case of unchecked negligence
into a disaster in which, perhaps, a community is
called upon to suffer.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a system that takes publicity
and the pocketbook for its principal factors enlists
every corrective element in its favor. You cannot
separate suspension and loss of pay from publicity,
to a certain degree. In all systems of punishment
or correction, in a police court or elsewhere, there
are usually two or three elements that are depended
upon to bring about beneficial results. These factors
are the shame that is attached to the publication
of names, the pecuniary loss in the shape of a fine,
and the danger of imprisonment. The Brown system<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
has abolished publicity and done away with
pecuniary loss. The employee is now aware that
no one can touch his pocketbook, no one can wound
his pride, or hold him up as an example to his fellows.
Of course it is too bad that a railroad man
should be called upon to take his discipline home
with him, that his wife and children should have to
share the shame and the penalty; and yet the decisions
of courts and of human tribunals everywhere
are all subject to the same criticism.</p>

<p>The Brown system, in a modified form, is to-day
the American method; and while its supposed primary
object may be to increase efficiency, its actual
working is all in the interests of harmony between
the men and management. The proof of the efficiency
of any system of discipline is to be found in
the freedom from accidents of all sorts. Within the
last few months, I have heard railroad managers
who heartily approve of the Brown system, deplore
in the same breath the alarming increase of accidents.
One of these gentlemen went so far as to
inform me that it is the only possible system, so
long as the men and the political influence of the
organizations are allowed to control the situation.</p>

<p>The men very much prefer to take punishment
on the installment plan, in the dark, to any settlement
on a cash basis in open and above-board fashion.
Discipline in the dark, on the installment plan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
has all the facts, experience, and records of the
past and present, and the probabilities of the future,
arrayed against it. When you ask the manager
how it happens that the United States does
not recognize the efficacy of the mental method on
the installment plan, and treat <i>him</i> as the Brown
system treats the employees, he merely shrugs his
shoulders. When an infraction of the &#8220;safety-appliance
law&#8221; or the &#8220;nine-hour law&#8221; is brought
home to a manager, the action of the government
or the law recognizing the superior efficacy of the
mental treatment might reasonably be expected to
say to him, &#8220;I give you ten demerit marks. Your
mistake has enlightened and purified you; go back
to your desk.&#8221; A manager is surely as susceptible
to mental influence and suggestion as an engineman
or a conductor. Yet there is not a suspicion
of the Brown system of discipline in the actual
fines and imprisonment which the government has
agreed upon as the best and quickest way to enforce
obedience in the interests of the public welfare.</p>

<p>The general introduction of the Brown system
on American railroads has been brought about by
the &#8220;irritation&#8221; of the men when their pay or their
time has been interfered with. This was, in general,
the power that gave the impetus and encouragement
to the movement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>The exact amount of &#8220;irritation&#8221; in loss of
money to employees for one month has been figured
out by one railroad, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>That is to say, a certain number of men had been
awarded &#8220;demerits&#8221; for offenses instead of suspension
with loss of pay, which in one month would
have amounted to $5559. Of course, most of this
amount would have been earned by spare men, but
this consideration by no means allays the &#8220;irritation&#8221;
of the regular men.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>Multiply this irritation by the number of railroads
in the United States, and the Brown system of
discipline is accounted for. From the safety point
of view, the greater the &#8220;irritation&#8221; the more evident
becomes the necessity for some system calculated
to control and put a stop to the negligence
that produces the irritation. The Brown system
very effectively allays this irritation at the expense
of the public safety, by treating the negligence as
a matter of secondary importance.</p>

<p>But although the Brown system and its modifications
may reasonably be termed the American
method, nevertheless here and there one comes
across an instance of an American railroad that
has discarded it and adopted a radically different
method, with exceedingly satisfactory results. One
of the roads that has broken away from the Brown
system is the Chicago &amp; Alton.</p>

<p>A few months ago, while in Bloomington, Ill.,
the writer paid a visit to what is termed &#8220;The C.
&amp; A. Stereopticon Car.&#8221; So far as I am aware,
there are only two or three of these cars on American
railroads. The car is, in fact, a training school
and lecture hall for the benefit of the employees.
Mr. Perdue, the man in charge, is a veteran employee
of over thirty years&#8217; experience, extending over
practically every department of railroad life. In
order to enter the service of the Chicago &amp; Alton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
every man has to pass through this car and take
the necessary examinations. In this way Mr. Perdue
has become personally acquainted with practically
every man in the operating department of the Chicago
&amp; Alton. He knows the weak men and the
strong men, and his watchful eye is over them all.
He has the necessary authority to call any man
into the car for re&euml;xamination, and to withhold
him from duty if necessary, in the interests of the
service.</p>

<p>Mr. Perdue kindly allowed me to remain in the
car while he was conducting the exercises. There
were some twenty or thirty railroad men seated
before him. The lecturer held in his hand a small
bundle of papers. They were the record of the disciplines
for the month. Some of the wrong-doers had
been called into the car to listen to a description
and an analysis of their mistakes. Mr. Perdue is
very kindly, yet forceful, both in manner and speech.
He talks vigorously to the men in their own everyday
language. He takes one accident after another,
and by the actual representation of it on his screen
he demonstrates just how it happened and how to
avoid it for the future. He then tells a certain man
to stand up, and questions him closely as to what
he would do under such and such circumstances.
Finally, he turns to his screen and shows his audience
how to smash a carload of household goods by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
rough handling and by giving careless motions,
and, on the other hand, how to be loyal to the road
and at the same time true to themselves by rendering
careful and efficient service.</p>

<p>Altogether Mr. Perdue&#8217;s work and story are so
interesting that I am tempted to give a part in his
own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have kept a record of the men handled during
the past two or three years. I promoted 148 brakemen
to be conductors, 264 firemen to be engineers,
and instructed in all 3839 men. Practically all the
men passed, because if they failed to begin with,
they kept coming to me until I had educated them
up to my standard. I believe the Chicago &amp; Alton
has the finest and most loyal body of employees on
any railroad in the United States. I may be accused
of blowing my own trumpet, but I honestly
believe it is nearly all due to my method of training
and discipline. By the way, this method is copyrighted
by President Murphy of the Cincinnati
Southern Railroad. Of course the method is one
thing, and the man who handles the method is another,
and a most important consideration. That is
why I point with pride to my record with the boys
on the Chicago &amp; Alton. I want them to get the
credit for it, for without their co&ouml;peration my work
would be thrown away. To begin with, I make a
point of getting the men interested, not only in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
their own records, but in the records and reputation
of the Chicago &amp; Alton. I tell you one thing, and
that is, you cannot, with impunity, malign or abuse
the Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad in the hearing of one
of my boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, again, I have no favorites. I make it a
point to work with absolute impartiality and uniformity.
Every man knows he must stand or fall
on his own merits, that is, on his record as a flagman,
a fireman, or an engineer; and when he gets
into trouble, his character as a man is taken into
account. Please don&#8217;t lose sight of the fact that I
made these Chicago &amp; Alton boys. I made good
men out of them because I aroused an interest in
every man. We are all proud to be able to say that
we work for the Chicago &amp; Alton, and we point to
our road as the best, safest, and most comfortable
in the country to-day. To give you an idea of our
splendid service, you should take a ride on our &#8216;Red
Train,&#8217; on &#8216;The Prairie Express&#8217; or &#8216;The Hummer.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In 1904, during the World&#8217;s Fair at St. Louis,
we carried thousands more passengers than any
other road, and we neither killed nor injured a single
passenger. I spent two thirds of my time riding
round with the boys during the Fair season. We
heard of numerous accidents happening on other
roads, and one thing leading to another, the word
was finally passed around, &#8216;Boys, not a scratch to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
passenger on the Chicago &amp; Alton.&#8217; And we lived
up to our motto, I can tell you. This kind of work
is part of my method. It is a system of personal
effort and personal direction, and I can tell you it
pays. If you don&#8217;t think so, just take a look at the
accident records of the other roads during the same
period.</p>

<p>&#8220;In regard to discipline, I don&#8217;t believe in being
too severe. It&#8217;s what you hold up your sleeve and
have the power to use periodically, that counts.
Yet we are severe enough on the Chicago &amp; Alton.
No merit or demerit marks for us. For minor
offenses, from five to ten days&#8217; lay-off, with loss of
pay. For neglecting to have your watch inspected,
we give as many as fifteen days&#8217; lay-off; and once
in a great while, the penalty for serious offenses
goes up to thirty days. But discipline to any great
extent is uncalled for. When a man has been
through my car, he may need it once, but very seldom
a second time. If you will compare the number
of preventable accidents on the Chicago &amp; Alton
during the years 1897, 1898, and 1899 with any
year or period since I took charge of this system
in 1900, you will get a very good idea of what the
&#8216;Stereopticon Car&#8217; and all that it stands for has
done for the Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>But now, making an end in this way of our survey
of conditions on American railroads, there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
yet one topic of another nature that should prove
unusually interesting to the general public.</p>

<p>To the writer of this book it has always
seemed strange that the public interest and anxiety
in regard to these distressing railroad accidents
should never yet have taken the form of a very
natural curiosity to find out to what extent and
by whom these matters have been systematically
studied and thought out. Doubtless the public has
the impression that its interests are being cared for
somehow by somebody. But impressions of this
kind must not be mistaken for evidence. What, for
instance, are the names of the employees, the managers,
the politicians, or the legislators who have
studied these railroad accidents at close range and
given the public the benefit of their investigations?
If these authorities have given little time and no
thought to the subject, the public should be informed
why they have avoided the discussion. As
a matter of fact, the investigation has been avoided,
practically by all hands, for the reason that no man
can honestly apply any kind of a probe to a serious
railroad accident without running the risk of a clash
with the labor organizations. No such neglect, for
this or other reasons, of a great public issue can be
pointed to in any other department of American industry
or civilization.</p>

<p>For instance, from time to time we read in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
public prints of prizes being offered by cities and
states, and sometimes by the national government,
for the best designs for some public building or
memorial. Without delay architects and artists all
over the country concentrate their minds on the
subject. Those who are capable of submitting valuable
opinions and plans are invited and encouraged
to do so. Money and brains and professional pride
are enlisted in the undertaking, and thus we actually
secure the best results that the concentrated
thought and talent of the profession is capable of
producing.</p>

<p>Now it will certainly occur to most of us that it
is quite as serious and important an undertaking to
try to save thousands of lives on the railroads as it
is to provide commodious and artistic public buildings.
Upon examination at close range, however, it
soon becomes evident that no concentration of
thought whatever is being directed to this safety
problem, such as all other questions of national importance
immediately bring into play. If this point
is well taken, it surely must result in bringing to
light a most unusual and almost incomprehensible
state of affairs. From my point of view, then, neither
money, brains, nor professional pride are in any way
enlisted in the undertaking, except along the lines
of least resistance. The lines of least resistance in
these railroad problems are concerned with and embrace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
all manner of signals and safety devices for
the protection of life and property. The thought
and money that are being lavished on this side of
the problem can be realized by a glance at any or
all of the scientific periodicals. But the lines of
greatest resistance, and at the same time of the
greatest importance, which call for a study of the
human element, that is to say of the conduct of
the men in relation to efficiency of service, have as
yet failed to receive the attention and thought
which the importance of the problem undeniably
calls for.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly this view of the matter will meet
with considerable criticism. It is a distinct reflection
on the policies and methods of the officials and
the authorities to whom the public is in the habit
of looking for assistance and enlightenment. Nevertheless,
a short consideration of the subject will, I
think, be sufficient to sustain my contention, and
at the same time it will serve as an introduction to
a chapter in the railroad business that is replete
with interesting particulars, as well from the industrial
as from the sociological point of view.</p>

<p>From the nature of the railroad business, with its
multiplicity of rules, signals, and customs, which
constitute the mysteries of the operating department,
little assistance is to be expected, in a direct
way, from the ideas and opinions of the general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
public in the devising or initiating of improved
methods of operation. Public opinion, however, has
its proper function and influence, which can be
profitably utilized in other directions.</p>

<p>In the same way, judging from experience and
our knowledge of the past, little assistance in the
way of thought or co&ouml;peration is to be anticipated
from the rank and file of the men. No amount of
public stimulation or official encouragement has so
far had any effect in rousing the average engineman,
conductor, or station-agent, and inducing him
to devote any part of his spare time or his talents
to a fearless discussion of these railroad problems,
which are so intimately related to the safety of the
traveling public. Neither in the railroad magazines
nor in the newspapers, will you ever come across
an article or any kind of appeal calling upon the
organizations to take a hand, in any public way,
by co&ouml;peration with managers or otherwise, in improving
the scandalous accident record, which at
the present day is the distinguishing feature of the
American railroad service. Every railroad man
seems to be a specialist in his own department, and
up to date there is no suspicion of a social conscience
in any way connected with his job or his
schedules. In a word, the employee has not devoted
to the subject of railroad accidents any systematic
thought or consideration whatever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>Turning now to the officials of our railroads, to
the train-masters, superintendents, and managers,
the evidence is even less satisfactory; for it must
be allowed that any systematic and persistent
study of these matters on the part of the railroad
officials would sooner or later become known to the
public, through the press. But there is absolutely
no evidence of the kind in existence. The press
of the country can be carefully scrutinized and
watched for an account of a railroad accident that
has been fearlessly and thoroughly analyzed by
railroad officials and published for the information
of the public. Personally, after carefully watching
the outcome of a score of cases, I am of the opinion
that the investigation of a railroad accident
by the management of an American railroad is
neither more nor less than a hushing-up process,
in which the officials are assisted by the railroad
commissioners, who frequently dodge main issues
by taking circuitous routes.</p>

<p>For instance, it cannot be denied that railroad
commissioners in general are aware that interference
with discipline in aggravated form is a recognized
principle on our railroads. The Massachusetts
Commissioners, for example, found themselves face
to face with the issue, a few years ago, during
their investigation of what is known as the Baker
Bridge disaster. In their report of this accident,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
they characterized the principle as vicious and let
it go at that; and yet they are just as well aware
as I am of the duties and habits of a grievance
committee, as well as of the fact that the privilege
of unlimited appeal from the discipline of the superintendent
is to be found in almost every agreement
between men and management.</p>

<p>I am not presuming, in any way, to define the
functions or duties of the railroad commissioners;
my object is simply to discover, if possible, by
whom and in what manner these railroad accidents
are being studied and analyzed in the interests of
the traveling public. All our evidence, therefore,
points to the fact that train-masters, superintendents,
and managers&mdash;that is to say, the only men
in the country who are thoroughly posted in all
the details of railroad life, and therefore the only
men with the ability and equipment to think out
these problems to successful solution&mdash;are absolutely
tongue-tied and pen-paralyzed on the subject.
Occasionally, perhaps, one of these gentlemen
may emerge from his seclusion with an interesting
essay on certain phases of railroad life. In a general
way he may call attention to the importance
of certain cardinal characteristics and virtues. He
may emphasize a sermon on the absolute necessity
of obedience to the rules, with numerous and interesting
illustrations; but when it comes to a question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
of enlightening the public in regard to the actual
working arrangements that exist between the management
and men, he immediately draws a wide
black line.</p>

<p>If a superintendent should have the temerity to
come out in the open and describe, for the benefit
of the public, the process of running his division
by a combination of rules, schedules, and grievance
committees, with himself as an almost impersonal
factor in the midst of it all, turning the crank
merely as director of the machinery, he would in
short order be called upon to back up his story
with his resignation. This would be a perfectly
natural consequence of his loyalty to the public
interests and of his lack of consideration for the
traditions and etiquette of his office. Not only is
this true, but his usefulness as a superintendent
would be at an end; he would be placed on the unfair
list by the employees, and thus he would quickly
become <i>persona non grata</i> to his superiors, whose
harmonious relations with the organizations he
would constantly be in danger of upsetting.</p>

<p>But if the public should think fit to follow up
the investigation suggested and initiated by the
superintendent in this way, it would quickly find
itself face to face with the fundamental antagonism
that exists in the highest railroad circles between
the <i>rival interests of harmony and efficiency</i>. So far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
as our railroads are concerned, this is the &#8220;land&#8217;s
end&#8221; of discussion on the safety problem. Harmony
is the altar upon which the interests of the
traveling public are continually being sacrificed.
Harmony is the final adjuster, arbitrator, and referee.
Harmony dictates the policy of the railroad,
the nature and severity of its discipline, while efficiency
follows in the rear, as best it can. Just as
soon as the public gets interested sufficiently in
preventable railroad accidents to call for all the
facts in relation to them, then, and not until then,
will harmony be dethroned from its dictatorship.
So I think I am justified in repeating the statement
that these preventable railroad accidents
and the causes which lead up to them have not
yet received proper attention and thought at the
hands either of the public, of the employees, or of
the managing bodies of the railroads. The superintendent
allows the public to remain in ignorance
out of regard for his job, and the manager does the
same in the interest of harmony.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined, however, that the
management is alone to blame in the matter. Only
too often, in the past, when a railroad manager, in
the interests of good service, has made a test case
of his power, he has had the public as well as the
men to contend against. As a matter of fact, even
at the present day, the public is not in a mood to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
give much credit or attention to explanations and
statements that emanate from railroad headquarters.
It is an uncomfortable truth that public opinion,
as a rule, looks upon official announcements or
reports of railroad accidents as being more or less
tainted, and the idea is deeply imbedded in the
public mind that a superintendent is open to the
same suspicion that is commonly attached to a
manipulator of stocks in Wall Street.</p>

<p>As it seems to me, then, the conclusion that little
enlightenment in regard to railroad accidents is
to be looked for from management or men has impressed
itself in some way on the public mind, and
the appointment of boards of railroad commissioners
to look after the public interests has been the
natural consequence. But when we come to hunt
up the evidence in regard to the study of railroad
accidents by railroad commissioners, a most unlooked-for
state of affairs is disclosed.</p>

<p class="caption">THE AFTERMATH</p>

<p>Undoubtedly most of the problems that come
up before the commissioners for solution are well
within the sphere of their talents and business
ability, but a fair and impartial investigation of
railroad accidents calls for a thorough examination
and sifting of the evidence by men who are actually
in touch with the working of the rules and the
movements of the trains. It is not sufficient for
commissioners to call for the evidence and to listen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
to a rehearsal of some of the rules that apply to
the case. A fair-minded and unprejudiced listener
at any &#8220;hearing&#8221; conducted by these boards would
quickly be impressed with the conclusion that in
New England, at any rate, the commissioners are
not fitted by training, study, or experience to furnish
the public with intelligent criticism of the
simplest case of a preventable railroad accident. I
have not the slightest hesitation in recording this
as the whispered opinion of all railroad men who
have given any thought to the subject, although, of
course, it would be highly imprudent for any one
to say so out loud.</p>

<p>Not only to railroad men, but to the public as
well, the following illustration will be as plain and
to the point as words can make it:&mdash;</p>

<p>On September 15, 1907, a head-on collision occurred
near West Canaan, N. H., between two
passenger trains, in which twenty-five passengers
were killed and about as many more injured. The
accident was the result of an error, either in
sending or receiving a train order&mdash;possibly both
the sender and receiver were at fault. One of these
men was the train dispatcher in the main office, the
other was a telegraph operator at a way station.
With a view of placing the responsibility and explaining
the disaster, an investigation was immediately
entered into by the Board of Railroad Commissioners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
of the State of New Hampshire. These
gentlemen were assisted in their duties by the attorney-general
of the state, their legal adviser. Replying
to the direct question of the board, &#8220;How
do you think this accident happened? What occasioned
it?&#8221; the general superintendent of the Boston
&amp; Maine Railroad, himself an operator and train
dispatcher, testified as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would say, in my thirty years&#8217; experience,
closely connected with the dispatching of trains,&mdash;we
run something like 700,000 trains a year,&mdash;I
have never known a similar error to be made and
I never have heard of it. The error certainly was
made, and due, as I believe, to a failure of the mental
process, either in the brain of the dispatcher at
Concord, the operator at Canaan, or both, and <i>it is
utterly impossible for me to determine which one
made the failure, or whether or not they both made
it</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such was the opinion of an expert railroad man,
recognized as such by the commissioners themselves.
Thereupon the general superintendent, at
the request and for the benefit of the board, entered
into a minute and exact account of the methods
employed in moving and handling trains on the
Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, in so far as this was
necessary to explain the situation at the time of
the accident. The narrative of the general superintendent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
was interrupted at frequent intervals by
questions from the attorney-general and the commissioners.
He, the manager, was called upon to
explain, not only the rules of the road, but the commonest
principles and movements in the train service.
&#8220;What is a &#8216;block&#8217;?&#8221; &#8220;What do you mean
by &#8216;O. K.&#8217; and &#8216;complete&#8217;?&#8221; &#8220;Explain in detail
your train-order system.&#8221; &#8220;As a matter of curiosity
let me ask how this signal works.&#8221; These questions
are not put as a mere legal form or habit, for
many of the points call for reiterated explanation
before they are comprehended by the board. The
language is plain enough: they don&#8217;t understand
this, they are not familiar with that, and the section
of track on which the accident happened they know
nothing about. In a word, the board goes to school
to learn something about the elements of railroading
and the details of train movements by telegraph,
and having in this way been thoroughly drilled into
an understanding of the accident, and having listened
to all the evidence, the investigation comes to
an end.</p>

<p>On October 11, 1907, the finding or report of
the commissioners was published. After reviewing
the accident, the evidence in relation to it, and the
methods of operation in the train service of the Boston
&amp; Maine Railroad, all of which was, in fact,
simply a reproduction of the testimony of the general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
superintendent, the board concludes its analysis
by pointing to the train dispatcher at Concord as
the &#8220;more than probable&#8221; transgressor, and actually
undertakes to describe the train of mental
wanderings by means of which the error was arrived
at! In the face of the declaration of the expert railroad
manager that it was impossible to single out
the offender, the commissioners, on the same evidence,
but without the expert understanding of it,
are satisfied to send this train dispatcher out into
the world with the stigma of implied guilt and
responsibility for the death of twenty-five people
on his head. Train dispatchers all over the country
were very much exercised and indignant at this
&#8220;finding&#8221; of the commissioners, and I am convinced
it would be very difficult to find a telegraph
operator in the United States who would be willing
to say a word in its favor.</p>

<p>That public officials should feel themselves justified
in expressing opinions having the nature of
verdicts, upon delicate questions relating to the
train-order system of train movements, while confessing
themselves ignorant of the terms &#8220;O. K.&#8221;
and &#8220;complete,&#8221; is beyond the comprehension of
railroad men; and public opinion would quickly see
the point and recognize the justice of this criticism,
if its attention should happen to be called to the
members of a naval board of inquiry, for example,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
whose previous experience had been such that they
were unfamiliar with the terms &#8220;port&#8221; and &#8220;starboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>A careful perusal of the foregoing arguments and
illustrations should have the effect of impressing
upon the public mind two simple, yet very significant,
conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the first place, it will be evident that the safety
problem on American railroads must be taken in
hand and solved by the people. The present tangled
condition of affairs can be straightened out only by
supreme authority.</p>

<p>And our second conclusion is the revelation that
the area in American industrial life covered by
these preventable railroad accidents and the causes
that lead up to them is practically, at the present
day, a <i>terra incognita</i>. Of course the railroad man
who steps out from the rank and file, and undertakes
to give away the plans and topography of the
country for the benefit of those who are interested
in improving conditions, exposes himself to all sorts
of cynical criticism in the minds of his fellows.
However, as a matter of fact, your true philosopher
thrives in this kind of atmosphere. He is born of
the battle and the breeze, and spends a lifetime in
fortifying the walls of his &#8220;tub,&#8221; into which, when
hard beset, he retires to enjoy himself.</p>
